Revealed: world’s largest meat company may break Amazon deforestation pledges again,"Brazilian ranchers in Pará and Rondônia say JBS can not achieve stated goal of deforestation-free cattle Bibles, bullets and beef: Amazon cowboy culture at odds with Brazil’s climate goals The life and death of a ‘laundered’ cow in the Amazon rainforest The world’s largest meat company, JBS, looks set to break its Amazon rainforest protection promises again, according to frontline workers. Beef production is the primary driver of deforestation, as trees are cleared to raise cattle, and scientists warn this is pushing the Amazon close to a tipping point that would accelerate its shift from a carbon sink into a carbon emitter. JBS, the Brazil-headquartered multinational that dominates the Brazilian cattle market, promised to address this with a commitment to clean up its beef supply chain in the region by the end of 2025.

The murders at White House Farm: should Jeremy Bamber still be in prison?,"Convicted in 1986 of killing five members of his family, he has always maintained his innocence. This week, new evidence could get him another day in court For Jeremy Bamber, 17 April is D-day. Today, he hopes his case will be sent back to the court of appeal for the second time, and his many supporters believe this will lead to his conviction for murdering five members of his family being quashed after 40 years in prison. They say this is an unsafe conviction at the very least, but maintain Bamber did not and could not have carried out the horrific crimes. Others, including most of Bamber’s surviving relatives, remain convinced that Bamber murdered his mother, father, sister and her six-year-old twin boys and should never be released. It could also be a huge day for the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body responsible for sending alleged miscarriages of justice back to the court of appeal. When the commission started in 1997, it was a beacon of hope for the wrongfully imprisoned – the first independent organisation set up to investigate and refer miscarriages of justice. But over the years it has fallen into disrepute, widely condemned as tardy, conservative and inept.

"Bibles, bullets and beef: Amazon cowboy culture at odds with Brazil’s climate goals","As the first climate summit in the Amazon approaches, a gulf is opening between what the area’s farming lobby wants, and what the world needs Revealed: world’s largest meat company may break Amazon deforestation pledges again The life and death of a ‘laundered’ cow in the Amazon rainforest Yellowstone in Montana may have the most romanticised cowboy culture in the world thanks to the TV drama series of the same name starring Kevin Costner. But the true home of the 21st-century cowboy is about 7,500 miles south, in what used to be the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, where the reality of raising cattle and producing beef is better characterised by depression, market pressure and vexed efforts to prevent the destruction of the land and its people. The toll was apparent along the rutted PA 279 road in Pará state. Signs of human and environmental stress were not hard to find during the last dry season. Record drought had dried up irrigation ponds and burned pasture grass down to the roots, leaving emaciated cattle behind the fences. Exposed red soil was whipped up into dust devils as SUVs and cattle trucks sped past on their way between Xinguara and São Félix do Xingu, which is home to both the biggest herd on the planet and the fastest erasure of forest in the Amazon.

Julie Christie at 85: her 20 best films – ranked!,"To celebrate the Oscar-winning actor’s birthday this week, we look back at the highlights of a six-decade career, from early classics such as Doctor Zhivago and Billy Liar to later roles in Finding Neverland and Away From Her. There are many things wrong with Kenneth Branagh’s galumphing slab of actor-manager Shakespeare, but Christie as Gertrude is not one of them. Her casting might have been conducive to the Oedipal side of the Danish prince’s feelings towards his mother – if only the director’s bombastic performance had allowed room for it.

"‘The goal of a protest song is to make people feel strong and alive’: Ani DiFranco on Broadway, Fugazi and 30 years of activism","The singer-songwriter answers your questions about 90s gigs with Tori Amos, her ‘humbling’ run in Hadestown and keeping hope alive in the Trump era Please talk about growing up in Buffalo, New York – the music scene there, and becoming an emancipated adult at 15. AugustoM As a child, I befriended Michael Meldrum , a local troubadour. He brought me around to his gigs and coffee houses. That was a cool, unique way to grow up, beside this alcoholic artist who hopped from girlfriend to girlfriend’s house. He he was smart and so well informed when it came to music. I was his shadow between the ages of nine and 13 or 14 or so. Beyond that, we parted ways. So when I was an emancipated minor at 15 and going into the adult world, it was with no protector by my side. I was out there in bars, on my own, running the open mic, playing gigs. I had an after-school job – I was trying to finish high school. I never managed to grow a thick skin; I’m still very open and porous. Somehow I survived all those years without cutting myself off.

Julien Baker and Torres: Send a Prayer My Way review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week,"(Matador) The two deep south songwriters ditch country’s rhinestones for a personal, defiant reframing of the genre’s tropes The origins of Send a Prayer My Way stretch back nearly a decade. The partnership between US singer-songwriters Mackenzie “Torres” Scott and Julien Baker germinated in 2016, when the pair performed together in Chicago. Scott subsequently suggested, in a text sent during the pandemic, that they make a country album. Accusations that the pair are jumping on an ongoing trend for high-profile pivots towards a Nashville-oriented sound – which has so far involved the likes of Beyoncé, Post Malone, Zayn Malik, Chappell Roan and Lana Del Rey – are thus diffused. Nevertheless, it still feels telling that Send a Prayer My Way arrives now. Baker has spent much of the 2020s as one-third of Boygenius, a collaboration with Lucy Dacus and Phoebe Bridgers that made her far more famous than her previous solo albums. It spiralled into something that resembled a genuine pop phenomenon, laden with awards and headlining Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl.

Every hour the system sends him a huge volume of posts, but he hardly ever deletes a single word. After three or four thousand posts accumulate, he lightly clicks his mouse and the whole lot is released. In the jargon of censors, this is a “total pass in one click” (一键全通), after which all the posts appear on China’s version of X, Sina Weibo, to be read by millions, then reposted and discussed. He logs on to the Weibo management page, where many words are flagged. Orange designates sensitive words that require careful examination – words like freedom and democracy, and the three characters that make up Xi Jinping’s name. While such words regularly appear in newspapers or on TV, that does not mean ordinary citizens can use them at will.

"Who are the death row executioners? Disgraced doctors, suspended nurses and drunk drivers","These are just the US executioners we know. But they are a chilling indication of the executioners we don’t know Being an executioner is not the sort of job that gets posted in a local wanted ad. Kids don’t dream about being an executioner when they grow up, and people don’t go to school for it. So how does one become a death row executioner in the US, and who are the people doing it? This was the question I couldn’t help but ask when I began a book project on lethal injection back in 2018. I’m a death penalty researcher, and I was trying to figure out why states are so breathtakingly bad at a procedure that we use on cats and dogs every day. Part of the riddle was who is performing these executions.

‘I was being a sassy Karen’: Florence Pugh’s skyscraper stunt positions her as the new Tom Cruise,"The star’s insistence on jumping from a 2,722ft skyscraper to up the action ante for Thunderbolts* may not be quite enough to save Marvel’s latest. But her career should fly If you ever needed definitive proof that Marvel has lost pace with the zeitgeist, just look at the panicky marketing of Thunderbolts*. The film opens in a couple of weeks and, according to the trade press, is tracking to open soft. Had this been six or seven years ago, then fans would be clamouring to see Thunderbolts* simply because it was the latest instalment of the grand MCU soap opera. After all, it’s a film that stars several side characters from older Marvel films and TV shows, and there was a time when audiences would go bananas for this sort of thing. But as the last few MCU films have shown, that approach doesn’t really work any more.

Can we stop pretending a trade deal with Trump will be a gamechanger for the UK. It won’t | Martin Kettle,"I’m not saying Britain should refuse every sort of free trade agreement with the US, but there may be options that better suit Labour’s purpose It’s a deal. The words sound good. Most human beings are primed to think of a deal as desirable in itself. It isn’t hard to see why. Agreement is generally better than disagreement. In most aspects of life, shaking hands under shared rules makes sense. So it takes a bit of effort to think more objectively. But it is important to do that now, especially in the case of the proposed UK trade deal with the United States. Even before Donald Trump became president again, and long before the US started its current tariff wars, there were already plenty of reasons for caution about what a free trade deal with the US might look like. In the wake of Brexit, these concerns centred on whether a deal could be struck – and sold at home – on bilateral trade issues such as pharmaceuticals, food products and digital regulation, on all of which very different standards and assumptions have long applied on the two sides of the Atlantic.

This is a very tough day for trans people – with a long legal road ahead to right this wrong | Robin Moira White,"The supreme court judgment is contradictory and confused. And there seems no prospect of the Labour government sorting this out Robin Moira White is joint author of A Practical Guide to Transgender Law A person has to be tough to be transgender. Given the problems that can be associated with coming out to family, friends and work colleagues, the constant vilification of trans people by certain parts of the media and on social media and the internal emotional turmoil transition entails, it requires mental strength beyond the ordinary. I should know – I have walked that path. Yesterday, transgender people were dealt a blow from a source I would not have predicted when I transitioned 13 years ago – the UK supreme court. In a case concerning representation on the boards of public bodies in Scotland, the supreme court ruled that in the 2010 Equality Act (EA), “sex” should be taken to be “biological sex”, in the sense of the sex recorded on a citizen’s original birth certificate, and does not include “certified sex” where a transgender person has obtained a gender recognition certificate (GRC) by the process set out in the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. This renders a GRC valueless for the purposes of the Equality Act.

"It's the economic end times, so obviously I'm thinking about my takeaway coffee | Emma Brockes","The true scale of what’s happening is hard to grasp, so our irrational brains reach for measly acts of self-denial Most of us, confronted with daily forecasts of recession and economic downturn, have an emotional response that expresses itself in a range of behaviours. Big purchases may be deferred or cancelled. Travel plans are revisited. We might review our childcare spend and wonder if we should go out less – all rational decisions in the face of the rising cost of living. Then there are the irrational gestures, those that have little meaning financially but offer us, via small acts of self-denial, an opportunity to feel we’re doing something morally rigorous. It’s these, in my case, that have lately been triggered. For me, the barometer has always been coffee, a small but ineradicable source of guilt that has only grown as the price of a single flat white creeps up towards £4. Forgoing this small pleasure neither damages my day, nor, on the other hand, does anything significant towards improving my finances. Assuming a one-coffee-a-week spend, the choice to wait until I get home to make coffee will save me about £200 a year. And yet, each time I pass Caffè Nero and keep walking, I’m so proud of myself you would think I’d donated a kidney.

"In a world full of wedgies, are you a wedger like Trump, or a wedgee like me? | Adrian Chiles","There are two sorts of people – those who pull others’ underwear, and those who have their underwear pulled. And we’d never have known it without the Lib Dems’ Ed Davey Sir Ed Davey has made more than one significant contribution to the tone of political discourse over the past year. Obviously, there’s all the surfing, rollercoasting, bungee jumping and so on. There’s also his use of the word “wedgie” in relation to trade tariffs. That’s some trick to pull off. Respect. Here’s what he said earlier this month: “Despite backing the US in every major conflict this century – and offering to water down our tax on US tech billionaires – we’ve been rewarded with the same tariffs as Iran. It’s like we’re meant to be grateful Trump gave our friends a black eye and left us with just a wedgie.” This was quoted on The World at One on BBC Radio 4 , which involved the presenter Sarah Montague using the word wedgie, too. Something else I never thought I’d hear. Even over where I work on BBC Radio 5 Live, where we’re less squeamish about using the vernacular, Davey’s wedgie-bomb came as a bit of a shock. But we soon gathered ourselves enough to hatch a plan on where we should go with the idea. My editor suggested it may be profitable to consider how mankind – and I believe we are talking about a largely male pursuit – can be divided into wedgees and wedgers. That is, those who have been wedgied and those who have done the wedging.

The face of British disability is increasingly young and female. It's time to hear from them | Frances Ryan,"My book about disabled women grew in relevance as I wrote it, exposing the heartlessness of proposed harsh benefit cuts When I began to write a book four years ago about life for disabled women in Britain, I didn’t bank on it being particularly topical. Stuck in bed with chronic fatigue and pain in my early 30s, I wanted to write something that would connect with other women navigating pillboxes and heat pads alongside careers and relationships. And so I decided to interview more than 70 women and non-binary people with physical and mental health conditions – from famous actors to legal experts, musicians to psychologists. The result was a vast and varied catalogue of disabled life: from stories about workplace microaggressions and good and bad dates on the apps, to finding freedom (and judgment) using mobility aids. What I didn’t anticipate was that as the months went on, and my word count went up, the disabled cohort I was writing about would grow to include more and more women – many of them even younger than me.

America used to fire the world’s imagination – but now the cultural conversation is being silenced | Van Badham,"Not only are TV-watching, book-reading, show-going, music-listening travellers declining to visit the US, we have started to cease to imagine it This week, fresh data revealed the United States has seen its biggest drop in Australian tourists since Covid . It’s hardly surprising. Innocent people are being snatched by authorities from American streets . Citizens of foreign countries are being stopped, shackled and detained . The EU is now sending its emissaries with burner phones , lest personal social media posts critical of President Trump be discovered by border agents and … who knows what happens next? Forcible relocation to a Salvadorian supermax prison, seemingly without chance of release , is suddenly not out of the question. It all seems like something from Hollywood dystopia; the V series, maybe. Or Escape from New York. It’s pretty much the plot line of the first season of Andor – which I strongly recommend that everyone watch before the Trump regime clocks what that show is advising and it vanishes faster than a copy of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl from an American high school library .

The Guardian view on UK-China relations: a dilemma made sharper by Brexit | Editorial,"The Eurosceptic model of a globalised Britain detached from its local continent has aged very badly in the era of Trump’s trade wars Even when the transatlantic alliance was more functional than it is now, there was not a united view of China. There has always been common wariness of Beijing as a commercial rival and potential security threat. But for hawks in Washington the idea of an alternative superpower closing in on economic and technological parity feels existential. More dovish Europeans have been readier to leaven caution with engagement. Britain has veered between the two poles. In 2015, David Cameron promised a “ golden era ” of open trade with China. In 2020, under pressure from the US, Boris Johnson banned Huawei, a Chinese telecoms company, from UK 5G infrastructure. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian view on Birmingham’s bin strikes: a wake-up call for Labour | Editorial,"England’s second city has become a symbol of political dysfunction. But the government should draw wider lessons from the chaos In the 1890s, a visiting American journalist described Birmingham as “the best-governed city in the world”. Inspired by the reforming spirit of its one-time mayor Joseph Chamberlain, England’s second city had become a showcase for a new kind of municipal government. Introducing better schools, libraries, parks and public baths, politicians were taking proactive responsibility for the health and welfare of the local population. Preachers of what was then known as the “civic gospel” are thin on the ground these days. Birmingham is currently a byword for political dysfunction, symbolised by the unhealthy piles of bin bags disfiguring its streets since an indefinite refuse workers’ strike began last month. Despite pressure from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who sat down with Unite representatives last weekend, the union and Birmingham’s Labour-run city council have now been in full-blown confrontation for close to six weeks. The impact has been particularly gruesome in poorer areas, where residents cannot afford the costs of commercial waste clearance. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Academies fuel explosion in school costs | Letter,"Cllr Jonny Crawshaw outlines the financial perils of an education sector that is no longer fit for purpose There is undoubtedly a crisis of funding hitting classrooms across England’s secondary education sector ( Half of England’s state secondaries forced to cut staff in budget squeeze, poll finds, 10 April ). It is not as simple as a lack of cash coming into schools, however (though this is a significant contributing factor). A cursory look at the published accounts of the many multi‑academy trusts (Mats), which now control at least 80% of state secondary schools in England, shows an explosion in chief executive pay, with many new ancillary roles – chief finance officers, executive headteachers and trust performance directors – also adding to “central services” bills. Many of these roles didn’t exist a decade ago, yet they leach millions of pounds each year out of the classroom and into the bank balances of the disproportionately white, middle‑class men who fill them.

The sinister psychology at the heart of populism | Letters,"Readers respond to George Monbiot’s piece on how economic inequality fosters resentment, exclusion and nostalgia George Monbiot ( Rightwing populists will keep winning until we grasp this truth about human nature, 13 April ) makes some very important points about the psychology of those who follow demagogues and rightwing populist leaders. But this knowledge is not new. After the horrors of the rise of the Nazis and the persecution by them of Jews and other minority groups before and during the second world war, psychologists, many of them Jewish, began to systematically study the origins of such hatred. One was Henri Tajfel , a Jew born in Poland whose family were murdered by the Nazis. Tajfel was primarily interested in group identity, and popularised the terms in-group and out-group. Most importantly for understanding our times, Tajfel’s work helped to show that not only do we work for, and experience reward through, the in-group’s success (familiar to supporters of any football club), but, more sinisterly, we will work for, and experience reward through, the detriment of the out-group, even if that also means the in-group suffers, so long as it is to a lesser extent.

Wagner: Der fliegende Holländer album review,"Finley/Davidsen/Sherratt/de Barbeyrac/Norwegian National Opera/Gardner (Decca, two CDs) The Norwegian soprano dominates in this recording taken from concert performances in which Finley’s Dutchman feels somewhat underpowered According to the sleeve notes, the two concert performances of Wagner’s most compact and regularly performed stage work that Edward Gardner conducted in Oslo last year are likely to be the only occasions on which Lise Davidsen will appear as Senta, since it’s not a role that she intends to sing on stage. That alone will make the set – taken from the two concert performances – a compulsory purchase for Davidsen’s many admirers, and certainly her performance is the main attraction here, though the feisty playing of the Norwegian National Opera orchestra , one of its first collaborations with Gardner after he became the company’s music director, is first-rate, too. But from the moment that she launches into Senta’s ballad in the second act, colouring it to spine-tingling effect, Davidsen holds the stage, and makes every set-piece compelling, putting Gerald Finley’s Dutchman entirely in the shade as she soars through their great duet. Yet her intensity is not sufficient for their pairing to strike real dramatic sparks. Alongside Davidsen’s larger-than-life quality, Finley’s portrayal seems rather small scale; his singing is as elegant and intelligently shaped as ever, his bass-baritone richly burnished, but the crucial heroic dimension is missing.

The Wedding Banquet review – muddled gay comedy remake plays it too straight,"Fire Island director Andrew Ahn’s update of Ang Lee’s seminal 1993 film works hard to differentiate itself but it’s awkwardly stuck between serious and silly Many remakes are utterly pointless, whether they’re disregarding what made a movie good or interesting in the first place, or paying such slavish homage that a second version becomes redundant, rather than a worthy variation. If nothing else, the contemporary reconfiguration of The Wedding Banquet passes the remake test handily. Ang Lee ’s original 1993 film is about a bisexual Taiwanese immigrant, living happily with his male partner, who hastily arranges a lavish (and, emotionally speaking, fake) wedding to a woman to please his visiting parents; director/co-writer Andrew Ahn, who shares screenplay credit with original co-writer James Schamus, relocates the story from 1993 Manhattan to 2025 Seattle, and contends with a whole different set of social rules and actual laws in the process. Ahn is so acutely aware of how times have changed, in fact, that he seems reluctant to mine the new situation for comedy. Lee (Lily Gladstone) and Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) are unmarried but committed lesbians about to go through their second expensive round of IVF. They can afford to live in the Seattle area largely because Lee has inherited her family home, where she yearns to start a family of her own; the couple also rents out a converted garage to Angela’s longtime bestie Chris (Bowen Yang) and his boyfriend Min (Han Gi-chan). Min, who comes from money, has been in the US on a student visa that’s about to expire, and his grandparents want him to return to Korea and help run the family business. A green card is just a marriage proposal away, but commitment-resistant Chris is hesitant to marry, especially for convenience. So Min makes a counter-proposal: he’ll secure some of his family money to pay for Lee and Angela’s IVF, and in exchange, Min will marry Angela, for a green card and for familial show.

Salty Brine review – daring diva mashup with hella pizzazz,"Soho theatre, London The drag queen’s latest intermingling of Annie Lennox covers, southern gothic literature, Judy Garland and family anecdotes is a bravura feat of idiosyncratic connection On his last London visit, Salty Brine mashed up the Smiths’ album The Queen Is Dead, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, and episodes from his own life into a pretty extraordinary show. But not a unique one – Brine has made 21 such confections as part of his Living Record Collection project, which now brings These Are the Contents of My Head (The Annie Lennox Show) to Soho. If I found this one less remarkable an achievement, the feeling was offset by admiration that Brine’s Smiths show was clearly no fluke; that he’s created a striking and confident collage-cabaret genre all of his own. Maybe that last one worked so well because Frankenstein described the form as well as the content. The fit is less neat here, as our drag-queen host splices Annie Lennox ’s album Diva, a recording of Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall, Kate Chopin’s feminist novel The Awakening and (I’m almost done …) tales from his own mother’s failed marriage. In this telling, both the novel’s heroine and Brine’s mum are women struggling to free themselves from marriage and societal convention. Tripping in and out of song, family anecdote and scenes from Chopin’s southern gothic, with additional characters played by scene-stealing pianist Ben Langhorst, Brine’s gumbo doesn’t stint on rich ingredients.

From girlhood she would write down goals for herself to reach, and she was just as driven at college and in her early career at Microsoft, where she famously met and married its billionaire co-founder Bill Gates. The couple divorced in 2021 . There is a small, sad moment in her memoir The Next Day where she writes of happily gaining weight in pregnancy because it was the first time she’d felt so free “from perfectionism … the crushing relentless societal pressure to look a certain way”. Only well into middle age, when a friend gently questions her constant self-improvement projects, does she wonder whether in her conscientiousness she had “missed opportunities to embrace spontaneity, lean into the unexpected”.

I’m obsessed with coastal wildflowers: they look so delicate but thrive in tough conditions,"From the rock sea-spurrey, which appears to grow out of solid rock, to the slender centaury that lives on a landslip, these plants exist where they do for good reason I first encountered coastal wildflowers when I was 11. I was visiting my grandmother’s friend in Devon and a lady said: “Here, dear,” and dug up a clump of Warren crocuses – a rare plant that, at the time, was only thought to grow in the seaside resort of Dawlish Warren. She gave them to me to grow in my garden at home. But of course they didn’t grow away from the sea. That was when I realised there was something special about coastal wildflowers. They fascinate me because, as well as being beautiful flowers, they often grow in tough locations. Take the rock sea-spurrey : a delicate little plant that appears to grow out of solid rock, such as a crevice in a cliff base. It can put up with being splashed with sea spray and baked by the summer sun. And yet it seems to thrive in that difficult, harsh environment.

"The death of customer service: why has it become so, so bad?","More than 75% of Britons say they are frustrated with poor service, and chatbot ‘helpers’ aren’t helping. Our consumer champion considers the problem – and how you can complain much more effectively It is a very modern feeling. That sense of dangling in limbo, enduring a tinny rendition of a Simply Red song down the line, and watching the morning drift away. It was my fourth call to customer services to discover the fate of a valuable delivery that had been attempted without warning three days earlier than agreed, failed to arrive on the first rearranged date, was a no-show on the second, and had subsequently vanished off the courier’s radar. “We don’t do time slots,” said the call centre operative, suggesting I wait in for another 12 hours the following day in case it turned up. A report by the thinktank New Britain last month found that 78% of people across the country feel frustrated when dealing with customer services – and that on average we spend between 28 and 41 minutes every week dealing with them in lengthy battles. According to the UK Institute for Customer Service (UKICS), satisfaction is at its lowest level in a decade – with 24% of the 15,000 respondents to its annual survey reporting a poor experience in 2024. The consumer group Which? found that energy and broadband customers , in the same year, lost an estimated 27.3m hours to poor customer service, which amounted to £298m in costs as consumers were left out of pocket when issues weren’t resolved.

A walk with Romans and ghosts on the Great North Road,"Tracing part of an ancient highway in Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire – now the A1 – proves rich in stories going back 2,000 years After a while it is clear that someone, or something, is following us. A figure, some distance back. But here’s the thing: it doesn’t appear to draw any closer, or get further away. It seems to remain, matching our pace, just at the edge of vision – at the edge of the dusk now descending over the grand Lincolnshire parkland surrounding Burghley House . When we stop, the figure vanishes. When we set off again, it returns. A shrouded shape; a shadow stalking our steps. Perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise. The old Roman highway we’ve been intermittently tracing from Water Newton to Stamford is a nine-mile track layered with history. Now overgrown and concealed, it was once a bustling leg of a great north-south thoroughfare that has run, in some form or another, like a backbone through the body of Britain for at least 2,000 years. A unique assemblage of ancient trackway, Roman road, medieval path, pilgrim route, coach road and motorway. Today, hereabouts, its modern incarnation – the A1 – loops west, leaving, as it does in many places, forgotten, discontinued ghost highways to their own devices.

Formed in 1975 amid a wave of protest, it was designed to address Māori grievances by determining whether the meaning of the country’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, was being adhered to.

Like the Ritz for wildlife: the joy of recreating England’s ancient hedges,"Up and down the country, volunteers are coming together to plant more of these nature-rich reserves The 30-metre ridge runs across the moor near Yar Tor on Dartmoor, one of several faint lines that crisscross the land like aeroplane contrails. Although the open moorland looks wild, we are standing on some of the UK’s oldest farmland. These ridges, called reaves, are the ghosts of farming’s most wildlife-rich legacy: hedges. “These reaves sadly have no function today other than to delight us. Or some of us,” says ecologist Rob Wolton. But Dartmoor’s reaves are the skeletons upon which more recent hedges were built: hundreds of thousands of miles of them. After Ireland, the UK is believed to be the most hedge-dense country in the world, and Wolton says the majority of them are more than 280 years old. Recent laser scanning shows England has enough hedges to wrap around the world almost 10 times. They are, by far, the country’s biggest nature reserve , which is why community groups, farmers and charities are rallying together to plant hedges of the future that will offer the same support to wildlife as the ancient hedges of the past.

"‘I hated my body and wanted a different one’: Penn Badgley on dysmorphia, sex scenes and playing a serial killer","He has been starring in the hit Netflix show You, as the psychopath Joe Goldberg, throughout his 30s. As the actor says goodbye to the role, he reflects on celebrity, controversy and masculinity Early morning in Penn Badgley’s house has the reassuringly normal noisy chaos that comes with a young family. The actor is in his New York home, preparing to talk about murder and manipulation, while listening out for signs that his wife, who is pregnant with twins, needs help getting their four-year-old son out of the door. She does; he excuses himself, and disappears for a few minutes. If Joe Goldberg, the serial killer Badgley portrays on the hit Netflix series You is controlling, devoid of love and unable to form relationships, Badgley appears to have created a life that looks the opposite. His time as Goldberg – the role that has been his highest-profile after his big break on another hit series, Gossip Girl – is about to come to an end. The series’ fifth and final season is about to air, and after that, says Badgley with a smile, “I don’t have to speak about Joe Goldberg ever again, if I don’t want to,” before adding: “Of course, I’m sure I will.” Continue reading...","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 04:00:01 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/16/i-hated-my-body-wanted-different-one-penn-badgley-dysmorphia-sex-scenes-serial-killer,The Guardian,UK,en,This Week,162
The mystery of the nameless girl found dead in a Spanish border town,"On a summer morning in 1990, the body of a young woman appeared in a small town close to the frontier. For those who saw her, finding her identity became an obsession that would last 30 years Nobody can recall who first phoned the police on the morning of 4 September 1990, but everyone remembers the girl. Her body, hanging from a pine tree on a steep slope above the Spanish frontier town of Portbou, was visible to anyone looking up from the beach or across from the opposite hillside. She was barefoot, with grey-blue eyes and thick chestnut-brown hair. She wore blue dungarees over a turquoise green shirt. Portbou, squeezed into a cauldron-like Mediterranean cove, had only 2,000 inhabitants but plenty of police officers. In these years before the Schengen agreement, guards were stationed on the French border but these officers were experts in immigration and smuggling, not violent deaths. Instead, Enrique Gómez, a 35-year-old investigator from the Guardia Civil police force was called in from the nearby city of Figueres to investigate. The phone call came as he was having breakfast in the canteen.

In reality, it was one of her toughest years. “The past two years have been really challenging,” says Standley. “I think there’s been a lot of erasure all around. I’ve noticed a lot less work.” She only worked a couple of times last year, she says, “compared with the two years before, where I was working continuously. I’ve definitely noticed, when it comes to [London] fashion week, there being no castings, and throughout the year, just a lot of regression, even from brands I’ve worked with.

Can the UK fix its broken prison system? – video,"The prison population in England and Wales has doubled in the last 30 years, with overcrowding now endemic across the system. But the government's strategy of easing this pressure by granting early release to thousands of offenders has had a knock-on effect. With many lacking stability on the outside, reoffending rates are high, exacerbating the existing problem. The Guardian visited Wales to see this playing out on the streets of Bridgend; and the Netherlands, to find out why the Dutch have closed more than 20 prisons in the past 10 years, seemingly in complete contrast to the struggles in Britain - and despite increasing levels of more serious crime seen across the country With thanks to Prison Escape Utrecht and Tap Social Movement Continue reading...","Tue, 18 Mar 2025 09:01:00 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2025/mar/18/can-the-uk-fix-its-broken-prison-system-video,The Guardian,UK,en,This Month,162

Refusing to fight: Israelis against the war in Gaza – video,"For many Israelis, military service is a rite of passage that lasts two to three years. Being such a formative part of the social contract in Israel, it is unusual for eligible young people to refuse their draft orders. Every year some ask for exemptions, but only a handful openly declare themselves as conscientious objectors, commonly known as refuseniks. However, since 7 October and the war in Gaza, refusenik organisations say the number of people refusing the draft has risen, even though during wartime punishments are harsher.

My parents holding hands after their assisted deaths: Martin Roemers’ most personal photograph,"‘Their lives were getting harder, even with help. They did not want to go to a nursing home and neither wanted to live without the other. So they left this life together’ This is a photo of my parents right after their deaths, in Assen, the Netherlands, on 1 May 2024. My father Klaas Roemers was 90, my mother Fenny Roemers-Visser was 86. They had a good life and a very happy marriage, but the last years were difficult. They were both sick and exhausted. Both had heart failure, my mother had a lot of pain. Both were in a really bad shape. They still lived in their own house but life was getting harder and harder, even with help. They did not want to go to a nursing home and neither wanted to live without the other – they wanted to step out of life together. They were afraid one would die naturally and the other would be left behind. They were very close, and did everything together, really everything – so it made sense they would leave this life together.

"‘Apparently, he had a fist fight with King Charles’: the jawdropping life of Luca Prodan, Argentina’s punk god","He was a gin-swilling Scottish-Italian heroin addict who set Argentina’s music scene ablaze – baffling the junta, who would arrest his audiences. As a biopic looms, we look at the fast life and early death of the still-worshipped frontman In 1980, a tall, thin man landed in Buenos Aires airport, at the height of Argentina’s military dictatorship. His name was Luca Prodan, a Scottish-Italian rocker, and he had just finished the last of his methadone on the flight over. His arrival would soon send shockwaves through Argentina when he started a band called Sumo, acquainted the country with post-punk, and became a national legend who lives on, his music still earning hundreds of millions of streams. “When I saw Sumo in 1982,” says Prodan’s younger brother Andrea, “I thought, ‘This is more than just a band. This is like the Velvet Underground.’” But, despite Prodan’s strong ties to Europe and his high esteem in Argentina, he is barely known outside of the country. That looks set to change – thanks to a forthcoming biopic called Time Fate Love, produced by Birdman co-writer Armando Bo. “Luca changed music history,” Bo says. “Here, he’s a god.” Continue reading...","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 15:50:45 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/16/fist-fight-king-charles-luca-prodan-argentinas-post-punk-god-sumo,The Guardian,UK,en,Today,162

Polio eradication review meeting says not a single case of polio reported since Feb 10,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday was informed that not a single case of polio had been reported in the country since February 10 due to the dedicated efforts of the nationwide anti-polio campaigns. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic, with the disease mostly affecting children under five, and sometimes causing lifelong paralysis. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress . The country recorded a total of 74 cases in 2024. Of these, 27 were found in Balochistan, 23 in Sindh, 22 in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, and one each in Punjab and Islamabad. This year’s first nationwide polio vaccination campaign was held in Feb, followed by a fractional IPV-OPV Polio (injectable polio vaccine) campaign in Quetta and Karachi on Feb 20 and 22, respectively.  Around 1 million children were targeted for vaccination in this campaign, according to the officials. Chairing the review meeting on Polio eradication in Islamabad today, the prime minister was told that as a result of the dedicated nationwide anti-polio campaigns, not a single case of polio had been reported in the country since February 10. According to The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) , the premier commended the efforts of relevant government institutions, international organisations, and partners to make Pakistan polio-free. He directed the relevant authorities to ensure awareness and community mobilisation regarding the anti-polio campaign across the country. “It must be ensured that every child under five years of age is administered the polio vaccine during the anti-polio campaign starting from April 21,” he said. He emphasised that alongside the campaign, nationwide routine immunisation for protection against other dangerous diseases should also be fully ensured. “Despite challenging conditions, the workers participating in the anti-polio campaign are playing a frontline role in the fight against this disease,” the prime minister said, adding that the entire nation, including himself, was proud of the hardworking polio workers. The premier was briefed about the upcoming anti-polio campaign from April 21 to April 27, during which 4.5m children will be given the polio vaccine. A total of 415,000 polio workers would participate in this nationwide campaign. The meeting was informed that, as per the prime minister’s instructions, third-party validation of the campaign would be completed from April 28 to April 30. Moreover, the cold chain tracking of the anti-polio campaigns was being monitored under a digital system. The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal, Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, chief secretaries of all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan, representatives of international partners, and other senior relevant officials. Sindh campaign to vaccinate over 10.6m children under 5 Separately, the Sindh government, in a statement, said that it was launching a province-wide polio vaccination campaign from April 21 to 27, aiming to vaccinate more than 10.6m children under the age of five against the virus. According to a statement issued by the Sindh Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), in Karachi alone, over 2.76m children would be targeted during the campaign. To ensure every eligible child was provided with the vaccine, approximately 69,724 trained polio workers would go door-to-door, as well as visit schools, shopping malls, and transit points across the province. Out of these, over 20,000 would be deployed in Karachi. A comprehensive security plan was in place, with 24,552 security personnel deployed to protect polio workers and support teams during the week-long campaign, of which 5,669 would be in Karachi. “Each dose of the polio vaccine is critical to building a child’s protection against this crippling disease. Parents must cooperate fully with vaccinators during the campaign and ensure every child receives the vaccine, every time,” APP said, quoting Irshad Ali Sodhar, EOC’s provincial coordinator. Sindh EOC mobilised district administrations, religious leaders, medical associations, and media organisations to help promote vaccination awareness and counter misinformation. Citizens were urged to fully cooperate with polio teams and encourage their families and communities to ensure that no child is left unvaccinated. If any child under the age of five has missed their polio drops, call the helpline 1166 or WhatsApp at 0346-7776546, the statement said. Presiding over a meeting of the Provincial Task Force for Polio Eradication, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said that the province reported four polio cases in 2025, compared to 23 in 2024 and 2 in 2023, emphasising the need for enhanced oversight and coordination across all districts in preparation for the upcoming vaccination campaign. “Our efforts this year must be focused on ensuring that every child receives the polio vaccine,” he said. Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho informed the chief minister that the province reported four cases of polio in 2025. The CM stressed the importance of district-level leadership in reaching every child and overcoming parental hesitancy through respectful, data-driven engagement. “Every refusal must be seen as an opportunity to educate and build trust,” he stated. “Deputy Commissioners must lead from the front and ensure daily supervision in the field.” Sukkur, Larkana, Hyderabad, and Mirpurkhas divisions have also had polio virus-positive environmental surveillance results. Therefore, parents must ensure their children are vaccinated properly and regularly to protect them from polio, the CM said. Dr Pechuho highlighted the need for sustained follow-up in communities affected by misinformation or vaccine fatigue. “We must strengthen the role of supervisors and ensure two to three visits to every household where vaccination was initially refused,” she said. “We must also continue integrating nutrition and routine immunisation with polio campaigns.” The chief minister concluded by urging all officials and elected representatives to support the polio teams during the campaign. “The virus is still present, but so is our resolve. We owe it to every child to make this campaign count,” he stated. “Let Sindh lead the way toward a polio-free Pakistan.”","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:31:32 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904858/polio-eradication-review-meeting-says-not-a-single-case-of-polio-reported-since-feb-10,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
Bill to establish commission for minority rights approved by Senate subcommittee,"The Senate Subcommittee on Human Rights on Thursday approved a bill to establish a commission on minority rights in accordance with United Nations and international standards and regulations. The meeting was chaired by Senator Ali Zafar, Convener of the Senate subcommittee. According to a copy of the bill seen by Dawn.com , the commission will “assess and monitor [the] implementation of the constitutional guarantees and safeguard for promotion and protection of rights of minorities”. It will also review existing or proposed policies or programmes to prevent discrimination and protect minorities, and provide recommendations to the relevant departments. According to the bill, the commission established by the prime minister will consist of 13 members, including two minority members from each province — a woman and a representative of the largest minority in that province. Additionally, the commission will include one minority member from Islamabad and one grade 21 officer each from the Ministry of Human Rights, the Ministry of Law and Justice, the Ministry of Interfaith Harmony and the Interior Ministry. “The chairperson and every other member … shall hold office for a term of three years,” the bill read. “There shall be a council to be established under this act,” the bill read. “The council shall exercise all powers, perform all functions, do all acts and things which
[are] assigned to it by the commission.” This 18-member council will include three Hindu members — including two from the scheduled caste — three Christian members; three Sikh members; one member friom Bahai; two Muslim members; an ex-officio member from the Council of Islamic Ideology; a representative of the Evacuee Trust Property Board; one representative each from the Provincial Human Rights or Minorities Affairs Departments; and one minority member from Islamabad. According to the bill, the commission may request information or a report from government institutions if it is inquiring a violation of minority rights. “Provided that if the information or report is not received within the time stipulated for the purpose, the Commission may proceed to inquire into the complaint on its own,” the bill added. “Without prejudice to anything contained in sub-section (1), if the commission considers it necessary, having regard to [the] nature of the complaint, it may initiate an inquiry without calling for any information or report.” “Today is a historic day for minorities which will be remembered forever,” Senator Zafar said, addressing the subcommittee. Human rights groups both in Pakistan and across the world have called on the government to protect the rights of minorities. In an open letter written on National Minorities Day last August, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan’s National Interfaith Working Group — comprising leaders from various faith communities, as well as lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders — demanded stronger protection for minorities.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:27:15 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904861/bill-to-establish-commission-for-minority-rights-approved-by-senate-subcommittee,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
More than 130 students in US join federal lawsuit over revoked visas,"More than 130 international students across the United States have joined a federal lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of unlawfully cancelling their visas, jeopardising their legal status in the country, court documents show. The students allege that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) abruptly and illegally terminated their status in the government’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (Sevis) database, putting them at risk of arrest, detention and deportation. The initial complaint was filed by 17 students on April 11 in the state of Georgia.
Since then, 116 more have joined them as the administration of US President Donald Trump pursues a wide-ranging immigration crackdown that has targeted foreign students, among many others. Across campuses in the United States, international students have been scrambling as they have discovered their visas have been revoked, often for little or no reason, according to court documents and media reports. The Georgia lawsuit names US Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons as defendants and seeks to reinstate the revoked visas. In the complaint, which does not identify the students by name “due to fear of retaliation”, the summaries offered for each of the 17 original cases reveal seemingly arbitrary cancellations, with each plaintiff giving their best guess as to what may have prompted them to be targeted. Some pointed to minor traffic infringements, such as John Doe 2, a Chinese citizen pursuing an engineering doctorate at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He was notified by his school that his visa was revoked after a criminal records check, but the violation was not specified. The student believes it may have been related to a traffic offence that was closed, and according to the filing, he has no other criminal history. Another of the students, an Indian national at New York Institute of Technology, said he had been found not guilty of shoplifting, and the case was dismissed. “Over the past week, visa revocations and Sevis terminations have shaken campuses across the country,” the complaint says. “The Sevis terminations have taken place against the backdrop of numerous demands being made of universities by the federal government and threats of cutting off billions of dollars in federal funding.” The suit also noted that students’ removal from the government database could jeopardise the individuals’ ability to reenter the United States in the future.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 19:01:31 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904863/more-than-130-students-in-us-join-federal-lawsuit-over-revoked-visas,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
"UN nuclear chief says Iran, US running out of time to secure deal","UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Thursday that Iran and the United States were running out of time to secure a deal. Iranian and US delegations are to gather in Rome on Saturday for a second round of Omani-mediated negotiations, a week after the longtime foes held their highest-level talks since US President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear accord in 2018. “We are in a very crucial stage of these important negotiations. We know we don’t have much time, this is why I am here … to facilitate this process,” Grossi said on a visit to Tehran. “We are working hard and we want to succeed,” he told a joint news conference with Iran’s atomic energy agency chief Mohammad Eslami, acknowledging that the search for a deal was “not an easy process”. On Wednesday, Grossi met with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the first round of talks with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday. Araghchi said he had a “useful” meeting with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief. “The IAEA can play a crucial role in the peaceful settlement of the Iranian nuclear file in the coming months,” he said. Araghchi called on the IAEA chief to “keep the agency away from politics” in the face of “spoilers” seeking to “derail current negotiations”. He did not elaborate. Grossi said their meeting was “important”. “Cooperation with IAEA is indispensable to provide credible assurances about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme at a time when diplomacy is urgently needed,” he said on X. Screenshot of Rafael Grossi’s post on X on his meeting with Seyed Abbas Araghchi, foriegn minister of Iran. — @rafaelmgrossi on X ‘Not far’ from possessing bomb Before heading to Iran, Grossi told French newspaper Le Monde that Tehran was “not far” from possessing a nuclear bomb. Western governments have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition Tehran has consistently denied . A year after Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran began rolling back its own commitments under the agreement, which gave it relief from sanctions in return for IAEA-monitored restrictions on its nuclear activities. In its latest report , the IAEA said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilogrammes (605 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent. That level far exceeds the 3.67pc enrichment ceiling set by the 2015 deal, but still falls short of the 90pc threshold required for a nuclear warhead. Since he returned to office in January, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” policy of punishing economic sanctions against Iran. In March, he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refused. On Thursday, the New York Times reported that Trump had blocked an Israeli plan to strike Iranian nuclear facilities in favour of seeking a negotiated deal. ‘Conflicting positions’ On Tuesday, Khamenei cautioned that while the talks with the US had started well, they could yet prove fruitless. “The negotiations may or may not yield results,” he said . On Wednesday, Araghchi said Iran’s enrichment of uranium was not up for discussion after Witkoff called for a halt. Witkoff had previously demanded only that Iran return to the 3.67 percent enrichment ceiling set by the 2015 deal. Araghchi said he hoped to start negotiations on the framework of a possible agreement, but that this required “constructive positions” from the US. “If we continue to (hear) contradictory and conflicting positions , we are going to have problems,” he warned. On Thursday, Iran’s top diplomat headed to Moscow on a “pre-planned” visit to the Tehran ally. The Kremlin said that Russia stood ready to do “everything” in its power to help resolve the standoff over Iran’s nuclear programme.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:23:53 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904849/un-nuclear-chief-says-iran-us-running-out-of-time-to-secure-deal,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
"Sindh govt committed to addressing transport, water and sanitation challenges: CM Murad","Sindh Government reaffirmed its commitment towards addressing Karachi’s urban mobility, water, and sanitation issues at a meeting with International Finance Corporation (IFC) delegation on Thursday. With a population of 20 million, infrastructure issues in Karachi run rampant, ranging from transport , water and sanitation. Last year, urban planners and climate change experts said that Karachi had become an “unliveable” city due to pollution, crumbling infrastructure, poor sanitation and waste management system. The meeting focused on future public-private partnership (PPP) initiatives and underscored the need for strengthening PPPs in sectors such urban mobility and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) as the chief minister detailed Sindh’s legal and institutional framework regarding PPPs. He also highlighted progress in sectors such as road networks, energy, health, education, and transport.  The IFC delegation was led by Linda Rudo Munyengeterwa, Director for Public-Private Partnerships, Privatisations & Corporate Finance Advisory. During the meeting, held at the CM House, CM Murad emphasised Sindh government’s commitment to addressing Karachi’s transport, water and sanitation challenges, highlighting the city’s importance as Pakistan’s economic hub. To this end, he pointed out the Sindh government’s efforts in terms of transport which included several Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, including the Green and Orange lines. Meanwhile, he said, work was underway on yellow and red lines along with other infrastructure projects. He further added that the Sindh government had already introduce d e-buses in Karachi and planned to expand its fleet to 800 vehicles. The IFC lead delegate outlined a mass transit strategy comprising four main components: BRT operations, urban rail systems, ferry services, and ride-hailing platforms. She suggested constructing a new 18.3 km BRT system in Karachi, financed through the World Bank, along with an integrated feeder bus network. The IFC also stressed the need for modern e-buses to reduce noise and air pollution in the city. It recommended implementing e-buses through PPP models, where operational costs, maintenance, and risks would be shared with private partners. The lead delegate talked about IFC’s experience in advising on over 500 projects globally and emphasised the advantages of e-buses, including cost efficiency, lower maintenance, and environmental sustainability, she informed that by 2024, 80 per cent of urban transport buses in successful models would be e-buses. Addressing Karachi’s water woes, the chief minister stated that Karachi requires 1,200 million gallons of water daily, stating that the current supply is insufficient, resulting in a significant shortfall. In this regard, he highlighted the under-construction K-IV project which is expected to add to the water supply once completed. The government is also working on plans to install desalination plants to treat seawater, he confirmed. The CM expressed interest in initiating water-related projects through the PPP model to address the water crisis while the IFC also recommended establishing water treatment plants for industrial use and proposed that water supply and sanitation projects follow the PPP model. The nine-member International Finance Corporation (IFC) delegation included: Country Manager Zeeshan Sheikh, regional Manager Ian Twinn, Regional Manager Mr Tonci Bakovic, Regional Operational Manager Mr Michael Opagi among others. From the Sindh government, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Principal Secretary Agha Wasif, Chairman P&D Board Najam Shah, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi, DG PPP Unit Asad Zamin, and other senior officials were present. The IFC team presented various successful global PPP models and praised the Sindh government’s PPP Unit and its overall policy framework. “Sindh is a province that has been implementing PPPs since 2008, and it truly stands as an example of how public-private partnerships should be done”, said Munyengeterwa while insisting on the need for more public-private partnerships. Expressing excitement at the prospect of future partnership opportunities, Munyengeterwa said, “IFC looked forward to showcase Sindh as a model for other provinces and even other countries”. “Hopefully, your success can serve as an international example of how to do PPPs the right way,” she added. The IFC and the Sindh government agreed to collaborate closely on future PPP initiatives in urban mobility and water management to improve service delivery and urban infrastructure in Karachi and beyond.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:40:15 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904859/sindh-govt-committed-to-addressing-transport-water-and-sanitation-challenges-cm-murad,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
"Hungary, Pakistan lift visa requirement for diplomatic passports","Hungary and Pakistan agreed on Thursday to mutually lift the visa requirement for diplomatic passport-holders in each other’s countries as its foreign minister visited Islamabad. According to the Foreign Office (FO), Hungary’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó was on a one-day visit to Pakistan on the invitation of his counterpart Ishaq Dar. He is accompanied by a high-level business delegation to explore business opportunities in Pakistan. Addressing a joint press conference in Islamabad with Dar, Szijjártó said: “We are happy that we were able to sign the agreement to the visa requirement for diplomatic passport-holders. We have done it because we want our relation to be even more intensified.” According to state-run Radio Pakistan , the countries agreed on mutual visa exemption for holders of diplomatic passports. Two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were also signed for cooperation in the culture and archaeology sectors. Pakistan and Hungary agreed to enhance their cooperation across various fields and strengthen collaboration at multilateral forums, including the United Nations, the report added. It stated that Szijjártó expressed satisfaction over the doubling of trade between the two countries, and noted the completion of food security and water management projects in Pakistan by Hungarian companies. “We are also offering four hundred scholarships to Pakistani students every year,” the minister was quoted as saying. Stating that agreements were signed in the fields of culture and archaeology, Szijjártó noted Pakistan and Hungary had “rich histories”. “Both countries have made serious sacrifices in order to ensure independence [and] sovereignty,” he added. Terming Pakistan as a reliable partner, Szijjártó said: “Hungary stands up for the extension of [Pakistan’s] GSP+ programme […] beyond 2027 as well, and I think this is a mutual interest of both of us.” In a post on X following his meeting , the Hungarian minister thanked Dar for his “hospitality as we mark 60 years of diplomatic relations with Pakistan”. “The agreements signed today are based on mutual respect, sovereignty and our shared conviction that dialogue must replace lecturing and interference in global politics,” he reiterated. Addressing the press conference, Dar said both sides have a common interest in cooperating in areas such as agriculture, energy, healthcare, information technology and industrial manufacturing.

He said: “There’s still a big threat of terrorists coming from Afghanistan, and this threat of terror comes with the danger of launching further illegal migratory waves towards Europe. “Therefore, Hungary values and appreciates the efforts made by Pakistan,” he added, emphasising that they contributed greatly to Europe’s and global security. Speaking about the three-year-old Russia-Ukraine war, Szijjártó said: “It’s shocking to see some European politicians trying to undermine the success of the peace negotiations in Ukraine.” He called on European countries not to “undermine the peace efforts of [US] President Donald Trump when it comes to bringing peace back”. The Hungarian minister stated that both sides believed in the importance of dialogue and that “mutual respect should be the basis of international politics”. “We do believe that the judgment, lecturing each other, cornering and criticising each other, which became the basis of international politics in recent years, have led to serious problems of global politics,” he added. Szijjártó called for promoting connectivity “instead of the world being divided into blocs again”. Pak-Hungary Business Forum Szijjártó arrived in Islamabad earlier today, where he was received by Additional Secretary Europe Muhammad Ayyub, the Hungarian ambassador and other senior officials, the FO said on X .

The FO,  in a press release issued yesterday, said: “Deepening collaboration in economic, trade, energy and investment sectors is the focus of the two governments. “Pakistan attaches high importance to bilateral relations with Hungary, which have gained strength due to regular high-level exchanges and commonality of views on regional and international issues,” it stated. The FO noted that 2025 marks the 60th year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. “An important hallmark of strong bilateral relations has been Hungarian oil and gas company MOL’s successful investment in Pakistan since 1999,” it highlighted.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 15:46:45 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904840/hungary-pakistan-lift-visa-requirement-for-diplomatic-passports,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
Foreign secretary in Bangladesh for FOC talks after 15-year diplomatic break,"Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch arrived in Dhaka on Tuesday for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC) after a 15-year break in diplomatic engagement with Bangladesh. In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka’s leaders — especially the ousted regime of Sheikh Hasina — stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm’s length. However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the disposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement. Baloch was welcomed by the director general of the Bangladeshi foreign ministry Ishrat Jahan, the Dhaka Tribune reported. She will lead Islamabad’s delegation at the FOC today, and Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin will lead the Bangladesh side, the report added. The outlet further stated that Islamabad proposed the consultations as part of its efforts to strengthen diplomatic ties with Dhaka. All bilateral issues will be discussed during the FOC, another outlet The Daily Star quoted diplomatic sources as saying. It also said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was expected to visit Bangladesh on April 27–28. Last month, PM Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone conversation with Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus where the two leaders reaffirmed their shared desire to further strengthen bilateral relations. In February, both countries started direct government-to-government trade after decades of troubled relations with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice. Direct private trade between the countries restarted in November 2024 when a container ship sailed from Karachi to Chittagong. It was the first cargo ship in decades to sail directly between the countries.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:28:12 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904837/foreign-secretary-in-bangladesh-for-foc-talks-after-15-year-diplomatic-break,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
Sidra shines as Pakistan set 206-run target for Thailand with Women’s World Cup spot in sight,"Sidra Amin top-scored for Pakistan women again as the hosts set Thailand a fighting target of 206 in their fourth One-Day International (ODI) encounter of the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 Qualifiers on Thursday. In the day-night encounter at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, a World Cup spot is up for grabs for the hosts if they get over the line in this all-important match. Sidra and skipper Fatima Sana’s partnership was crucial for the Green Team after being in trouble earlier in the innings. Pakistan’s batting woes continued as the hosts lost regular wickets and could not up their scoring rate in the early half of their innings after opting to bat first. When Fatima joined Sidra at the crease, the score was at a dismal 85-4 in 32 overs. View this post on Instagram The Green Team’s batting effort did not get off to the best of starts with the medium pace of Phannita Maya getting the better of Shawaal Zulfiqar, who was playing her first match of the tournament today. The right-hander was playing in place of newcomer Gull Feroza. She fell while trying to break the shackles after Thailand were brilliant with their bowling discipline in the powerplay, hardly bowling a bad ball upfront. Next to go was in-form top-order bat Muneeba, getting out in a tame manner to spinner Onnicha Kamchomphu’s off-spin. She got a top-edge while sweeping a straight forward delivery to get dismissed by an easy catch in the circle. Player of the match for Pakistan in their encounter against Scotland — Aliya Riaz fell to a run out again. Her dismissal was reminiscent of the way she got out in the previous match against the West Indies  — getting run out by miles after a mix-up in the middle with Sidra. Veteran bat Sidra, however, was again the player who stepped up during a moment of crisis for Pakistan. She scored her third 50 in four innings in this tournament to bring the hosts back into the match. She scored 80 of 105 deliveries in an innings that held the Pakistani effort together. She scored eight boundaries as she proved her mettle as the veteran batter of the side. Thailand dropped six catches, including the Pakistani skipper, in their bowling innings, giving the hosts plenty of chances to recover. Skipper Fatima made the most of her luck, scoring an unbeaten 62 of 59 with 5 boundaries and a six and powering Pakistan past the 200 mark in the last over of the innings. Earlier in the day, Pakistan had won the toss and chose to bat against Thailand on a pitch that didn’t seem to be spin as much as the Green Team’s previous encounter against the Windies. The Green Team are looking to continue their winning streak in the tournament after the hosts spun their way to victory against the West Indies by 65 runs on Monday. Pakistan went top of the table again after the win and continued their dream run in a bid to qualify for the World Cup scheduled for later this year in India. They won on the back of performances by Player of the match Sidra Amin and the bowlers in the clash against the Windies. Pakistan were the favourites going into this encounter against Thailand, being the higher-ranked side, with the winning momentum of being unbeaten in their first three matches of the tournament going into this clash. Thailand came into this match after a high-scoring encounter against Ireland, where they lost by 46 runs after being set a 306-run target by the Irish side. The six-team ICC event — which includes Bangladesh, Ireland, Scotland, Thailand and West Indies alongside hosts Pakistan — features a single-league round-robin format with the matches taking place at the Gaddafi Stadium and LCCA ground in Lahore. The tournament will decide the two qualifiers for the 2025 Women’s World Cup to be held later this year in India. Pakistan, however, will be playing their matches at a neutral venue after a “fusion” model was decided upon following India’s refusal to play its matches in Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this year. Teams Pakistan: Shawaal Zulfiqar, Muneeba Ali, Sidra Amin, Aliya Riaz, Natalia Pervaiz, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper), Fatima Sana (captain), Rameen Shamim, Diana Baig, Sadia Iqbal and Nashra Sandhu.

"Judges transferred to IHC not to hire lawyer to defend seniority case, SC told","Three judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have chosen not to hire lawyers as the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench heard a case related to their transfer to the apex court and subsequent changes in the seniority list. The bench — headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and comprising Justices Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Salahuddin Panhwar, and Shakeel Ahmed — took up petitions filed by five IHC judges , the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) and the IHC Bar Association, among others. In February, Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC) were transferred to the IHC . The controversy centres around the alteration of the judges’ seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the senior puisne judge , which paved the way for his appointment as the acting IHC CJ after Justice Aamer Farooq’s elevation to the SC. The federal government had already submitted a written response, in which it requested that the SC reject the petitions. In the previous hearing, the court had issued notices to the three judges, the attorney general, and the registrar office of all four high courts. Hearing At the outset of today’s hearing, Justice Mazhar remarked that the three judges had been sent notices and inquired where their lawyers were. To this, the Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan replied that he had received a message from all three judges saying that they have decided not to appoint a lawyer, and that they would accept whatever decision is made by the Constitutional Bench. He also informed the SC that a permanent chief justice of the IHC is not being appointed, nor is this on the agenda of the Judicial Commission. “The commission is informed 14 days in advance for the appointment of a permanent chief justice. Currently, the chief justice is not being appointed,” the attorney general said. He further said that the judicial commission would take up the matter of appointing a chief justice to the Peshawar High Court and BHC in their meeting on May 2. Advocate Faisal Siddiqui said he had not made any request for the IHC Bar Association’s application to be withdrawn, and it had been withdrawn without his instructions to do so. Justice Mazhar said the executive council of the IHC Bar Association passed a resolution to withdraw the application. “The affected judges have filed a separate application themselves. According to the Bar Association resolution, the association’s application was filed without the permission of the executive council,” Justice Mazhar said. Advocate Siddiqui said his statements should be part of the record, to which Justice Mazhar said: “If the bar itself is withdrawing the application, what can anyone else do?” The court then dismissed the IHC Bar Association’s application based on its withdrawal. Justice Mazhar then inquired whether any provincial government had submitted a written response. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Advocate General said they support the constitutional requests of the IHC judges. Justice Mazhar reiterated his question, to which the KP Advocate General said he has yet to submit a response. Justice Mazhar said he noticed that all relevant parties had received notices and the bench would not take long to decide. While speaking to Advocate Munir A. Malik, who was representing the five IHC judges, Justice Mazhar said: “We need to hear from you; we will resume daily hearings from Tuesday.” “The federal government has submitted a written response. However, the
federal government has not submitted a statement of willingness of the transferred judges in its response. “The statement of willingness of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the concerned chief justices, including the president, has not been submitted on this issue,” he said. The attorney general said the entire process has taken place with the consent of everyone and is not controversial. “If this matter is not controversial, then you should submit a statement of willingness,” Justice Mazhar said, which the attorney general agreed he would do. Justice Afghan remarked: “We need to see where this matter stemmed from.” The court then adjourned the hearing till April 22.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:16:12 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904841/judges-transferred-to-ihc-not-to-hire-lawyer-to-defend-seniority-case-sc-told,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75

"Peace, liberty in country today result of soldiers’ sacrifices, says army chief","Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir on Thursday asserted that the “peace and liberty” in the country today was the result of sacrifices made by soldiers. The army chief made the remarks during an investiture ceremony held at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi today, according to a press release issued by the military’s media affairs wing. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said COAS Munir conferred military honours, including Sitara-i-Imtiaz (military) and Tamgha-i-Basalat, on officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Army in “recognition of their exceptional valour in operations and distinguished service to the nation”. During the ceremony, which was attended by a “large number of senior military officials and families of the award recipients”, medals awarded posthumously were also received by the martyrs’ families. Paying homage to the martyrs and veterans, the COAS was quoted as saying: “ Shuhada (martyrs) and ghazis (warriors) are our enduring pride. Their honour and reverence are a sacred trust upon every Pakistani. “The peace and liberty we cherish today are the result of the ultimate sacrifices rendered by these valiant sons of the soil.” COAS Munir also expressed “profound admiration for the resilience and fortitude” of martyrs’ families, acknowledging their unparalleled sacrifices for the homeland, the ISPR stated. It added that the army chief commended the “unyielding resolve” of the Pakistan Army and law enforcement agencies (LEAs). He also appreciated their “relentless efforts in thwarting multiple terrorist threats and eliminating high-value terrorist operatives during ongoing counterterrorism operations”. Gen Munir’s remarks come just two days after he vowed to remove “whatever stands in the way of Pakistan’s progress” and reaffirmed the state’s determination to counter terrorism. “Do Pakistan’s enemies think that a handful of terrorists can decide the fate of Pakistan?” he said, adding that “even ten generations of terrorists cannot harm Balochistan and Pakistan”. Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. Militant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).

California sues US govt over Trump tariffs in strongest pushback yet,"California is suing the federal government over US President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again tariffs, the governor and attorney general said on Wednesday, claiming the American president does not have the right to impose them. The move marks the strongest pushback yet against a tariff roll-out that has sent global stock markets into meltdown, and left businesses across the US fretting about uncertainty. “It’s the worst own-goal in the history of this country,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said. “One of the most self-destructive things that we’ve experienced in modern American history.” With 40 million people and a large, outward-facing economy that accounts for 14 per cent of US GDP, California looks set to bear the brunt of the economic damage forecasters expect from recent gyrations. Newsom’s office says California — which would be the world’s fifth-largest economy if it were an independent country — could lose billions of dollars in revenue if Trump’s tariff policies shrink international trade. Trump has long prized tariffs as a tool to achieve what he says is the urgent task of rebalancing America’s trading relationships, and pledged on the campaign trail that he would hit imports with extra levies. Initial punitive tariffs against Mexico and Canada were built on with his self-declared “Liberation Day,” which saw onerous charges imposed on scores of countries, including allies and partners. Many of those duties have since been paused, but their chaotic announcement sent global stock markets into spasms, wiping out trillions of dollars of value. Newsom said Trump’s economic mismanagement was costing everyday Americans — including many who voted for Trump — dearly, all while feathering the nests of billionaire donors and friends. The US, he said, has gone in a matter of weeks “from free capitalism to crony capitalism, just like that”. “This is the personification of corruption…this is smash-mouth, in-your-face, every minute of every day, every hour.” “How in the hell are we sitting by and allowing this to happen?” said Newsom, who is widely expected to put himself forward as a candidate for the presidency in 2028. The legal action launched on Wednesday argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump has used to impose levies as high as 145pc, does not grant him the authority to put tariffs on goods coming into the United States. “We’re asking the court to rein in the president… and uphold the Constitution,” Attorney General Rob Bonta told reporters. “The president is yet again acting as if he’s above the law, he isn’t.” Bonta said the power to impose tariffs rests with Congress, and the suit sought to ensure his actions were rolled back. “It’s simple, Trump does not have the authority to impose these tariffs. He must be stopped.” The case is the latest of more than a dozen lawsuits that California has filed against the Trump administration. A White House spokesman quoted by local media dismissed the lawsuit. “Instead of focusing on California’s rampant crime, homelessness, and unaffordability, Gavin Newsom is spending his time trying to block President Trump’s historic efforts to finally address the national emergency of our country’s persistent goods trade deficits,” the spokesman said.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:55:29 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904826/california-sues-us-govt-over-trump-tariffs-in-strongest-pushback-yet,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
"Liverpool’s Van Dijk commits future to club, signs two-year contract","Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk on Thursday committed his future to the Premier League club, signing a new two-year contract. The Dutch defender follows Mohamed Salah in ending months of speculation by extending his stay at Anfield, with fans preparing to celebrate winning the English Premier League title. “I’m very happy, very proud,” said Van Dijk who, like Salah, would have been out of contract at the end of the season. “There are so many emotions obviously that go through my head right now speaking about it. “It’s a proud feeling, it’s a feeling of joy. It’s just incredible. The journey I’ve had so far in my career, to be able to extend it with another two years at this club is amazing and I’m so happy.” Van Dijk, who has made 314 appearances for Liverpool, said last month that he had “no idea” if he would remain at Anfield but on Sunday hinted that he was set to carry on. The imposing centre-back, 33, had been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain but said his heart had been set on staying at Liverpool. “It was always Liverpool,” he said. “That was the case. It was always in my head, it was always the plan and it was always Liverpool. “There wasn’t any doubt in my head that this is the place to be for me and my family. I’m one of Liverpool. Someone called me the other day an adopted Scouser — I’m really proud to hear these things, it gives me a great feeling.” Van Dijk, who arrived from Southampton in January 2018, has been instrumental in Liverpool’s rise back to the top of the English and European game. He won the Premier League , Champions League , FA Cup , two League Cups, the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup under former manager Jurgen Klopp. With new deals confirmed for Salah and Van Dijk, the future of England defender Trent Alexander-Arnold remains unresolved. Alexander-Arnold, who returned to Liverpool training on Wednesday after a month out because of injury, is out of contract at the end of the season and has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid. Liverpool, in Arne Slot’s first season in charge, are on the brink of winning a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title. The Reds are 13 points clear of Arsenal with just six games remaining and could wrap up the title this weekend if the Gunners lose.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:32:02 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904854/liverpools-van-dijk-commits-future-to-club-signs-two-year-contract,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75

According to a statement issued by the KMC on Wednesday, “The KMC has decided to impose a Rs15,000 fine on individuals found driving in the wrong direction on the city’s main roads.” “The decision has been made to curb traffic violations and enhance public safety. The fines will be enforced through city wardens,” it added. “A resolution supporting this measure will be formally presented in the upcoming City Council session for approval and implementation,” it added. The KMC said that the initiative was under consideration on the directives of Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab and the high-powered Karachi Task Force which he chaired. According to Mayor Wahab, taking strict action against one-way violation is essential to prevent accidents and improve traffic flow in Karachi. “The KMC urges all motorists to follow traffic rules and cooperate with enforcement personnel to ensure road safety across the city,” the statement added. Opposition expresses reservations Leader of the Opposition in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin of the Jamaat-i-Islami expressed his reservations about the proposal. He said he had already discussed the matter with senior KMC officials. “We had a detailed meeting with Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad on the issue, during which we made our position clear i.e. the city wardens do not have legal authority to impose fines for traffic violations,” he stated. He said that the opposition supported the deployment of city wardens to assist traffic police. “However, granting them power to impose fines might lead to misuse and exploitation. The idea is more likely to backfire than deliver meaningful results.” In 2008, the defunct City District Government Karachi had during the time of Mustafa Kamal established a community police department . The same department was renamed as city wardens after the provincial government, police and several political and religious parties expressed their concerns about the community police. Talking to Dawn , DIG-Traffic Pir Muhammad Shah said that the deployment of city wardens would significantly support the traffic police’s efforts in managing traffic across Karachi. He noted that the addition of manpower would enhance the ability to ensure the smooth flow of traffic on the city’s major roads. “We’ve only had the support of city wardens during Ramazan, and their presence made a noticeable difference,” he said. “If they are deployed throughout the year, it would undoubtedly strengthen our efforts and significantly boost the manpower essential for managing the city’s traffic,” he added.

Afghan envoy says Kabul ready to take care of returning refugees,"PESHAWAR: Afghan consul general in Peshawar Hafiz Muhibullah Shakir on Wednesday said the interim government in Kabul was prepared to “take care” of Afghan refugees on return from Pakistan. He also said a high-level delegation of the interim Afghan government would soon visit Islamabad to discuss mechanisms for the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan. “They [refugees] are worried that after living here [in Pakistan] for 45 years, they fear facing issues in Afghanistan, but let me assure them that won’t happen,” Mr Shakir told a news conference at the Afghan consulate here. The Afghan consul general said the interim Afghan government would take care of refugees on homecoming. Says Afghan delegation to discuss repatriation with officials in Islamabad He said a commission, consisting of 12 committees with members from almost all departments, had been formed to address issues related to the repatriation of Afghan nationals from Pakistan. “They [refugees] would have faced issues only had there been Russians or Americans in power in Afghanistan, but this won’t happen as it’s us [Afghans] in power there. The journey has begun. There is peace, and there is no problem,” he said, adding that the Afghans will rebuild their country together. The Afghan consul general said the refugees, who lacked accommodation across the border, would be accommodated in camps established for them. He said besides the Afghan government, philanthropists had also come forward and announced building houses and assisting the returning Afghan nationals in managing businesses. When asked about those Afghan nationals, who had lived for decades in Pakistan and established businesses besides owned properties, Mr Shakir said that the delegation visiting Pakistan would hold talks on how to address those problems as, besides businesses and properties, some Pakistan might owe things to Afghan nationals and some Afghan nationals to Pakistanis. He also said that the first phase of the repatriation of Afghans from Pakistan was always difficult but it had begun and the problems would be resolved. Although the first phase of repatriation of unregistered Afghan nationals began in September 2023, a second phase was also launched on April 1 when the deadline for repatriation of ‘registered’ Afghan refugees expired on March 31. According to official documents, 509,267 Afghan nationals, including 22,148 Afghan citizen cardholders, have left for Afghanistan since Sept 2023, while repatriation of both ACC holders and illegal Afghan nationals is still under way. On Monday, the Afghan foreign ministry expressed concerns and urged Pakistan to stop forced deportation of Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. The Bakhtar News Agency quoted the Afghan ministry for foreign affairs as saying that Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlavi Amir Khan Muttaqi met Pakistan’s acting ambassador to Kabul Obaidur Rehman Nizamani to discuss key political and economic issues. It added that Mr Muttaqi expressed concerns and disappointment over forced deportation of Afghan refugees and the mistreatment by certain Pakistani authorities, calling such behaviour provocative and harmful to bilateral relations. He called for a change in the approach. Mr Nizamani acknowledged the concerns and said that the issue would be shared with relevant authorities in Pakistan. Both sides also emphasised the importance of taking mutually constructive steps and encouraged high-level visits and dialogue to strengthen ties.

SC refuses to issue special orders on Imran’s prison meeting,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refrained from accepting a plea seeking special instructions to allow PTI founder Imran Khan to meet with his legal team in prison. Senior counsel Salman Safdar told a bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Yahya Afridi that the former PM was facing extraordinary circumstances, with over 300 cases lodged against him. Therefore, special instructions from the court were required to allow him to hold meetings with his legal team at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. The three-member Supreme Court was hearing appeals related to the May 9, 2023 , arson and attack incidents. The proceedings involved petitions challenging Mr Khan’s physical remand and appeals against the restoration of his pre-arrest bail. CJP says legal team can interact with PTI founder whenever they want The bench, however, avoided accepting the plea, with the CJP observing the court would not issue any direction in this regard. However, he said, meetings would take place whenever the counsel wanted to interact with the PTI founder. During the hearing, Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi requested Imran Khan’s physical remand, stating that polygraph and voice-matching tests had yet to be conducted, and alleged that the PTI founder was not cooperating. The CJP cautioned the prosecutor against making such remarks in court, prompting Mr Naqvi to take back his words. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court issued notice to PTI leader Sanam Javed against her acquittal in the May 9 case with an observation that why her physical remand was required, particularly as she is a woman. The special prosecutor responded that the Lahore High Court had discharged Ms Javed after she challenged her remand. The Supreme Court also deci­ded to hear Fawad Chaudhry’s appeal against the registration of multiple cases for the same crime. Referring to the case regarding the cancellation of bail of Shehryar Afridi, the Supreme Court ordered the trial court to complete the trial in four months. The Supreme Court also adjourned the hearing of Sheikh Rashid’s acquittal appeal in the GHQ attack case until April 22. Sheikh Rashid’s lawyer said there was no witness against his client.

Gujar Khan food poisoning incident remains a mystery,"GUJAR KHAN: The cause of food poisoning which affected approximately 1,500 people in the Dhoong village of Gujar Khan still remains a mystery for both the authorities and the residents, days after the incident. The affected persons were treated by health teams in area hospitals as well as at the ‘hospital on wheels’ stationed in the village. A large number of guests after eating meals at a marriage ceremony on Sunday evening started complaining of intestinal disorders and nonstop vomiting. Deputy District Health Officer (DDHO) of Gujar Khan Dr Umer Sheikh, who was present at the basic health unit (BHU) in Dhoong on Wednesday, said while checking patients that over 1,500 individuals had reported food poisoning symptoms and were attended to by medical staff. Of these, 1,470 have been discharged, while 30 are still under treatment at BHU Dhoong and Daultala. One patient, whose condition was serious, was referred to Rawalpindi. Dr Sheikh added that seven patients who had earlier been shifted to hospitals in Rawalpindi have now been discharged after recovery. He stated that most patients complained of diarrhoea, vomiting, high fever, nonstop abdominal and intestinal pain, and, in some cases, shivering and acute weakness of the lower body. Dr Arbab Niazi, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the District Health Authority Rawalpindi, told this reporter that medical officers and support staff from other areas were deployed to BHU Dhoong and a health centre in Daultala. Health facilities in Gujar Khan, Qazian, Guliana and Mandra were also placed on high alert to manage the influx of patients. The CEO said he had made multiple visits to ensure the availability of medicines and staff around the clock. Raja Shakeel Chohan and Saleem Chohan, members of the host family, told Dawn that they had arranged cattle for slaughter and supervised the beef preparation themselves. They said the beef was handed over to the local cook, who is now in police custody after an FIR was registered with Jatli police station. When asked about the large attendance, they said two cousins — Amir Chohan and Saqib Chohan — were the grooms and the event involved extended family. Amir Chohan and 25 of his close family members had come from Committee Chowk, Rawalpindi, and were also affected. Residents criticised the Punjab Food Authority for its absence and inaction during the large gathering, including another wedding in neighbouring Tarrati village.

Deadly zealotry,"FEARS that mob attacks on international fast-food franchises would end up in tragedy have come true, after police say a worker at a foreign chain was shot dead in Sheikhupura earlier this week. The killing occurred after a TLP anti-Israel protest had wound up. Law enforcers say two men targeted a foreign chain, firing shots from the outside, resulting in the death of Asif Nawaz, a restaurant worker who was reportedly present in the outlet’s kitchen. Earlier, several foreign eateries in various cities and towns of Sindh and Punjab had been vandalised by mobs ; disturbing footage on social media shows men armed with clubs invading an outlet in Rawalpindi , as workers and patrons, including women and children, take cover. All of this is being done ostensibly in solidarity with Palestine. However, the murder and bullying of innocent people only besmirches the just Palestinian cause. The authorities must crack down on this violent behaviour before more tragedies occur. Sadly, extremist outfits are using the name of Palestine to stay relevant in society. Some of the groups involved have also been attacking religious minorities, particularly in Punjab. The attacks on food outlets have continued, despite leading clerics calling upon people to keep boycotts peaceful . There is no denying that Israel is carrying out a genocidal war in Gaza. However, murdering innocent people, and attacking firms assumed to be supporting the Zionist state, is indefensible. Consumers are free to non-violently boycott brands they feel may be supportive of Israel. But there can be no space for the ferocious vigilantism of extremist groups, which use emotive issues to stay in the headlines. These same groups also weaponise the sensitive issue of blasphemy to forward their dark agendas. The state must arrest and bring to justice those involved in the Sheikhupura murder, while the elements involved in attacking eateries elsewhere also need to be traced and punished. There can be no tolerance for such vile behaviour.

Freak hailstorm upends life in country’s north,"• Four killed in parts of Punjab, soldier loses his life due to deluge, lightning strikes in KP • ‘Golf ball-sized’ hailstones damage vehicles, solar panels; gusts uproot trees, power pylons • Flash floods disrupt traffic on Peshawar-Torkham Highway KHYBER/ISLAMABAD: A freak hail and thunderstorm swept across parts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the federal capital on Wednesday and claimed several lives across both provinces, damaging public and private property as well as standing crops. The rain also induced flash floods in KP, which also affected traffic, particularly on the main Peshawar-Torkham Road, where traffic remained suspended for up to five hours due to a swollen stream. In Islamabad, hailstones “as big as a golf balls” damaged vehicles and solar panels, while Tarnol remained the most-affected area, where strong winds uprooted trees and power pylons. The storm followed several dry and hot days in the northern part of the country, as the region witnessed ‘vertical instability’ when hot air rising from the plains of Punjab came in contact with the cold winds coming from northern Iran, leading to a temperature contrast. “Hailstones are formed due to this combination of varying temperatures, but extreme weather events are becoming more common, and the large size of hailstones was one of them,” said Dr Zaheer Babar, a spokesperson for the Met Office. The ‘golf ball-sized’ hailstones damaged property across the capital, with multitudes of people sharing photos of broken car windscreens and windows. Homes and markets were seen littered with debris and hail, and even the roof of the Faisal Mosque sustained some damage. One person died after a wall of a mosque collapsed in the Ratta Amral area of Rawalpindi, and two lives were lost in Gujar Khan after a wall collapsed onto a trolley passing through a street in Sohawa. In Muzaffargarh, a shopkeeper was killed in a lightning strike in Pull Magsan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, an army man was killed after a lightning strike struck his bunker in Khyber’s Landi Kotal area. Local administration and Rescue 1122 said that sepoy Ilyas Khan, a resident of Bara, was killed on the spot after being hit by lightning. The downpour also caused flash floods, in which a car was swept away. Besides the suspension of traffic on the Peshawar-Torkham highway, the rainwater also entered the transit camp established for Afghan nationals near the Hamza Baba mausoleum, which affected the registration process of the families being deported. In Charsadda district, heavy rain coupled with hailstorms damaged standing crops of wheat and tobacco, vegetables, fruit orchards, and uprooted trees and electricity poles. The downpour and gusts in Tangi, Shomali Hashtnagar, and other areas also played havoc. Crops and vegetables were also damaged in Bajaur tribal district due to heavy rain coupled with strong winds. Residents told Dawn that the storm started at about 3pm and was witnessed in most parts of the district. But, they mentioned that Khar, War Mamund, Lowi Mamund, Nawagai and Salarzai tehsil were among the areas most affected by the hail. Four people were slightly injured when a vehicle plunged into a deep ditch after it veered off the road due to rainfall. The incident happened near the Jar bridge in Bajaur. In Mardan, rain and thunderstorms uprooted trees near Sharmakhano Bridge on the Mardan-Malakand road, which severely affected the traffic flow, lasting more than several hours. Wheat crops in several parts of the district were also damaged due to the strong winds. The farmers feared that the damage due to rain and hail was going to affect the yield of wheat crops. Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has said that it was fully prepared to deal with the flood situation in Khyber districts and other areas of the province. The PDMA has also sought a report about the damages caused by the heavy rains and floods from the district administration of Khyber. “We have been monitoring the situation and were in contact with the respective district administration,” said PDMA Director General PDMA Asfandyar Khattak, said a statement. All necessary steps have been taken to pay compensation and redress the losses caused by the recent floods, he said.

"El Salvador becoming ‘black hole’ for US deportees, critics fear","Rights groups are increasingly worried that El Salvador’s notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot) prison is becoming a “black hole” for the United States to rid itself of expelled migrants or other unwanted people with no legal consequences. A US senator who travelled to the Central American country on Wednesday to try and retrieve a man wrongly deported and locked up there was sent away without even being able to speak to him. The man, Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia, is one of nearly 300 migrants —mostly Venezuelans — that the Donald Trump administration has sent to El Salvador since January without any court hearing. Once there, they were locked up in the infamously harsh Terrorism Confinement Centre built to house gangsters rounded up in President Nayib Bukele’s iron-fisted anti-crime drive. Observers say most of the migrants had committed no crime, and many had enjoyed asylum status in the United States. None have been heard from since they were sent to El Salvador, where they are now in legal limbo. Human Rights Watch , in a report last week, said El Salvador and the United States have subjected dozens of people to “enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention”. At the Cecot, they are held incommunicado, not allowed even contact with lawyers. “What they are trying to create here is a Guantanamo on steroids… a black hole where there is no legal protection for the people there,” Juan Pappier, HRW’s Americas’ deputy director, told AFP , referring to the US prison for terror suspects at a military base in Cuba. It is synonymous with torture and other abuses. ‘Illegally abducted’ The deportation of Abrego Garcia, in particular, has sparked an outcry and set off a legal crisis. A view of the sign of the Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot) prison, where alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the MS-13 gang recently deported by the US government were transferred to be imprisoned as part of an agreement with the Salvadoran government, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in this handout image obtained on March 31, 2025. Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia/Handout — Reuters Trump officials have claimed he is an illegal migrant, a gang member and involved in human trafficking. He has never been convicted of any crime and had been granted a protected status that should have barred his deportation to El Salvador. A federal judge, backed by the Supreme Court, has ordered Abrego Garcia’s return, but the Trump administration contends he is now solely in Salvadoran custody. Bukele, who has proudly adopted the moniker of “world’s coolest dictator”, has said he does not have the power to send the man back. Hoping to heap political pressure on the Trump administration, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen visited El Salvador on Wednesday to plead the case of Abrego Garcia, who he said was illegally abducted from the United States. Van Hollen met Vice President Felix Ulloa, who denied him all access to the man. “His answer was that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador, the government of El Salvador, to keep him at Cecot,” the senator said of the response he got from Ulloa. Family members of Gustavo Aguilera, 27, and Kenlyn Rodriguez, 34, Venezuelans whom the US alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang and sent to the Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot) prison in El Salvador, hold pictures of them, in Caracas, Venezuela on March 29, 2025. — Reuters/Gaby Oraa Washington and San Salvador have shrugged off criticism of their collaboration, and Trump on Monday warmly thanked Bukele for “helping us out” with his administration’s mass deportation drive. El Salvador is receiving $6 million to house the migrants, and Bukele left Monday’s meeting with an agreement for his country to join the US Global Entry programme, which allows expedited visa entry. 350 deaths AFP interviewed several relatives of Venezuelans detained in El Salvador, all of whom insisted their loved ones were not criminals. Alexis de Hernandez, mother of 31-year-old Andry Hernandez Romero, said her son was rounded up “just for having tattoos”— a common complaint in this drama. Salvadoran police officers escort alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the MS-13 gang recently deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) prison, as part of an agreement with the Salvadoran government, in San Luis Talpa, El Salvador, in this handout image obtained on March 31, 2025. — Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia/Handout — Reuters US officials have claimed the markings indicate loyalty to Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang, but experts note that the group — unlike Salvadoran gangs —does not use tattoos for clan identification. According to Cristosal , nearly half of the Cecot detainees it has been able to trace had asylum status in the United States or were applying for asylum, “which should protect them from deportation.” Trump has encouraged Bukele to build more jails and said Tuesday he would “love” to start also sending American citizens who commit violent crimes to the Cecot. The Washington-based Wola advocacy group warned in a commentary published on Monday that “thousands of citizens are languishing in El Salvador’s abusive prison system” and “at least 350 people have died in custody as a result of these conditions”. “Corruption and lack of transparency [in El Salvador] should be of bipartisan concern” for the United States, it argued. “The US must not only monitor how its financial assistance is being used, but also examine whether it is inadvertently supporting a government that systematically withholds information and evades accountability.” Header image: Salvadoran police officers escort alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the MS-13 gang recently deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot) prison, as part of an agreement with the Salvadoran government, in San Luis Talpa, El Salvador, in this handout image obtained on March 31, 2025. — Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia/Handout — Reuters","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:26:42 +0500",https://www.dawn.com/news/1904823/el-salvador-becoming-black-hole-for-us-deportees-critics-fear,Dawn News,Pakistan,en,Today,75
UK court orders YouTuber Adil Raja to pay legal costs in defamation case,"LONDON: A London high court on Wednesday ordered a UK-based YouTuber to pay legal costs in a defamation case brought against him by a retired Pakistani military officer. Adil Raja, the YouTuber who served as a major in the Pakistan Army, was ordered to pay £6,100 in legal costs to retired Brigadier Rashid Naseer after a half-day hearing held before Master Davison. The proceedings addressed three preliminary applications ahead of a full trial, scheduled to take place in six weeks. The court heard submissions on procedural matters, including an application by Raja seeking permission for his witnesses — including journalist Shaheen Sehbai, retired Col Akbar Hussain, and former PTI accountability czar Mirza Shahzad Akbar — to give evidence remotely. The judge allowed the request in principle, but noted that remote testimony from the US was a routine matter and questioned the need for a formal application. A second application involved an anonymous witness, whose testimony Raja had intended to present but later withdrew. Although Rashid Naseer had no objection to the principle of anonymity, the judge declined to order costs immediately, leaving the matter to be decided at the end of the trial. The third application was filed by Naseer, seeking an order for costs after Raja had delayed payments from a prior court ruling. While Raja’s legal team argued that previous payments had already been made, the court ruled in Naseer’s favour and ordered Raja to pay £6,100 within 14 days. Following the hearing, Adil Raja described the outcome as a “two to one” win, highlighting the judge’s decisions to permit remote testimony and defer cost rulings on the withdrawn witness, though acknowledging the order for him to pay costs on the third issue. The case, which centres around allegations made by Raja on his online platforms, will proceed to a full trial in late July.

Punjab announces Rs15bn package for wheat farmers,"• Financial support to be made through Kisan Card • Farmers’ bodies reject initiative, say it will benefit millers LAHORE: The Punjab government announced on Wednesday a package of Rs15bn for farmers amid reports of falling wheat prices at the time of harvesting, with growers holding rallies in different parts of the province. Under the Wheat Support Fund, 550,000 wheat farmers will be given direct financial support through the Kisan Card . The government also announced an exemption for wheat farmers from paying irrigation/fixed tax during the current year. Under the package, free storage Electronic Warehouse Receipt (EWR) facility will be provided for four months to protect wheat from climate change effects and farmers from market pressure. The government decided to implement the EWR system in the province. The farmers storing wheat under this system will get an electronic receipt. Within 24 hours, this receipt can be given to the bank to obtain a loan up to 70 per cent of the total cost (of wheat stored). It also decided to pay a markup against loans obtained from the Bank of Punjab up to Rs100bn to flour mills and green license holders for wheat purchase. The cabinet’s approval will be sought for immediate and mandatory purchase of wheat by flour mills and green licence holders. Wheat storage up to 25 per cent of the total storage capacity has been made mandatory. Punjab decided to contact the federal government for the export of wheat and wheat products. The Bank of Punjab will provide financing to the private sector for the renovation and construction of warehouses for wheat storage. The Punjab government will pay a markup of Rs5bn to provide storage facilities to the wheat farmers. The ban on transportation of wheat and flour at provincial and district borders has been lifted. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed her resolve that she would not let farmers suffer any loss. Last year, the Punjab government did not buy wheat due to grain imports during the caretaker government led by Mohsin Naqvi. This led to considerable drop in wheat price. ‘Package to benefit feudal lords’ Meanwhile, Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee general secretary Farooq Tariq rejected the government’s package, saying the farmers needed Rs4,000 per maund wheat rate. “This Rs15bn package is aimed at benefiting the feudal lords and influential persons and not farmers,” Mr Tariq claimed. Farmers Itehad central chairman Khalid Hussain Baath has also rejected the package. “This is not a package for farmers, but for capitalists. The EWR system is designed to benefit of the wealthy, while it exploits small farmers,” he said. “Farmers in villages don’t have storage facilities — this system is bound to fail. This package isn’t for wheat procurement, it’s a vehicle for corruption,” he said. “Five billion rupees are being handed over to capitalists in advance. The real beneficiaries of this package will be flour mills and green license holders, not the farmers,” Baath said. “The EWR system is economically murdering farmers. By dismantling the systems of Passco and the Food Department, the government is inviting disaster. The farmer has been given neither a fair price nor any guarantees,” he declared. “No official rate has been fixed — farmers are being left at the mercy of exploitation. This isn’t a relief package, it’s a continuation of anti-farmer policies. We urge the chief minister and the PM to immediately review this decision,” he demanded.

EU lists seven ‘safe countries’ to curb asylum claims,"BRUSSELS: The European Union on Wednesday published a list of seven countries it considers “safe”, in a bid to speed up migrant returns by making it harder for citizens of those nations to claim asylum in the bloc. The list — which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia — would need to be approved by the bloc’s parliament and members before entering force. The move, criticised by rights groups, is set to allow EU governments to process asylum applications filed from citizens of those countries more quickly — by introducing a presumption that such claims lack merit. “Many member states are facing a significant backlog of asylum applications, so anything we can do now to support faster asylum decisions is essential,” said Magnus Brunner, the EU’s commissioner for migration. Move described as ‘hollowing out refugee rights’ Brussels has been under pressure to clamp down on irregular arrivals and facilitate deportations, following a souring of public opinion on migration that has fuelled hard-right electoral gains in several countries. The commission said EU candidate nations would also in principle meet the criteria to be designated as safe countries. But it also laid out exceptions, including when they are hit by a conflict — something that would for example exclude Ukraine. The EU had already presented a similar list in 2015 but the plan was abandoned due to heated debates over whether or not to include Turkiye , another candidate for membership. The list published on Wednesday can be expanded or reviewed over time and was drawn up looking at nations from which a significant number of applicants currently come, the commission said. Several member states already designate countries they deem “safe” with regard to asylum — France’s list for instance includes Mongolia, Serbia and Cape Verde. The EU effort aims to harmonise rules and ensure that all members have the same baseline. States can individually add countries to the EU list, but not subtract from it. Asylum cases will still have to be examined individually, ensuring that existing safeguards remain in place and asylum-seekers are not rejected outright, the commission added. ‘Hollowing out refugee rights’ The plan has to be approved by the European Parliament and member states before it can enter into force. But it has already come under fire from civil society groups, with some lamenting the inclusion of countries with a patchy human rights record like Tunisia and Egypt. “Anyone who applies for protection in the EU should have their individual claim assessed fully and on its own merits — regardless of where they are fleeing from,” said Meron Ameha Knikman of the International Rescue Committee. She described the proposal as “part of a broader trend towards deterrence and hollowing out refugee rights”. The European Commission noted that Tunisia has detained political figures, lawyers, judges and journalists, while in Egypt rights and opposition activist may face arbitrary arrest and torture. But the population as a whole did not “face persecution or real risk of serious harm”. “This is a flagrant violation of a fundamental human right, the right to asylum, as an individual right,” the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, an NGO, told AFP decrying the EU plan. Irregular border crossings detected into the European Union were down 38 per cent to 239,000 last year after an almost 10-year peak in 2023, according to EU border agency Frontex. But led by hawks including Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands, EU leaders called in October for urgent new legislation to increase and speed up returns and for the commission to assess “innovative” ways to counter irregular migration. Currently, fewer than 20pc of people ordered to leave the bloc are returned to their country of origin, according to EU data. Last month the commission unveiled a planned reform of the 27-nation bloc’s return system, which opened the way for member states to set up migrant return centres outside the EU. Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi on Wednesday hailed the EU’s latest move as “a success for the Italian government”.

"Kulbhushan Jadhav got consular access after court martial, not appeal, Constitutional Bench told","ISLAMABAD: Defence Min­istry lawyer Khawaja Haris Ahmed on Wedn­esday informed the Sup­reme Court that Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was not allowed the right to appeal in light of a 2019 International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict , as the international court had only addressed the issue of consular access in that case. The Indian spy’s case was mentioned before the Constitutional Bench in response to earlier arguments, claiming the right to appeal was provided to the Indian spy, but the same facility was not being extended to Pakistani citizens who had been convicted by the military courts for their involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence. At The Hague, it was claimed before the ICJ that Pakistan was in breach of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 for not providing the facility of consular access to foreign nationals accused of spying, the counsel told the seven-judge Constitutional Bench. As a result, Pakistan enacted the International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act 2021, Khawaja explained, adding the law allowed for the review and reconsideration of military court orders, including those related to foreign nationals, to ensure compliance with the Vienna Convention. Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the seven-judge Constitutional Bench had taken up a set of 38 intra-court appeals (ICAs) moved by the federal government, provincial governments, and the Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the Oct 23, 2023 , judgement. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar recalled that the basis of the ICJ law was the enunciation by the superior judiciary, especially in the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case, in which more rights were provided to the accused. During the hearing, Justice Musarrat Hilali recalled how the Said Zaman judgement by the Peshawar High Court had initially irked the federal government, but was later cited as a defence before the ICJ in favour of Pakistan’s courts. The judge even recalled how then-PHC chief justice Waqar Seth had received a phone call, informing him that his judgement was being quoted before the world court. Mr Jadhav was captured in Balochistan in March 2016 and later confessed to his association with the Indian spy agency and his involvement in espionage and terrorism in Pakistan. In 2017, the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) had awarded him the death sentence, which was confirmed by the then army chief. The AAG also informed the court that Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan was busy in deliberations over the question of providing the right to appeal before the superior courts to the convicts of May 9 incidents, for which he needed a couple of days. Justice Mazhar also wondered whether the right provided to the foreign national through the law was equivalent to Article 199 of the Constitution, and how they could be compared. Article 199 (3) deals with the jurisdiction of the high court, but bars them from issuing orders in relation to a member of the armed forces or who was for the time being subject to any law relating to the armed forces. The counsel explained that through the law, a window was opened to provide consular access to the Indian spy, while also conceding that it was a unique jurisdiction. Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail again asked the counsel whether any proceedings against the accused could be initiated without the registration of FIRs and whether any provision in this regard existed in the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952. The counsel explained that under Section 157 of PAA, a court of inquiry was constituted. After the findings of the inquiry, the court martial proceedings were initiated against the accused, adding that there was no requirement for the registration of an FIR against people who were subject to PAA. The counsel claimed that the procedure adopted by the military court in trying the accused on May 9 met the requirements of fair trial standards.

Dismal outlook for trade as US-China standoff deepens,"• WTO warns of ‘severe negative consequences’ after US slaps levies of up to 245pc on some Chinese sectors • In Malaysia, Xi reiterates call for unity against US ‘unilateralism and protectionism’ GENEVA / WASHINGTON: Global trade is expected to plummet this year following US President Donald Trump’s tariff offensive , fuelling uncertainty that threatens “severe negative consequences” for the world, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) warned on Wednesday. Since returning to office, Trump has imposed staggering tariffs on the imports of goods from around the world. But while he placed a brief pause on made a U-turn on steeper tariffs for dozens of countries, Trump has escalated a trade war with China, slapping 145 per cent levies on Chinese goods. Beijing has countered that with a 125 per cent duty on all US products. In the latest bout of one-upmanship, the White House has said that China could face tariffs of up to 245pc . Trump initially imposed 20pc tariffs on imports from China over its alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain, then added 125pc over trade practices that Washington deems unfair. “If the US really wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop exerting extreme pressure, stop threatening and blackmailing, and talk to China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, reacting to the announcement. The reciprocal tariffs add onto any existing tariffs already in place. For example, the Biden administration had placed a 100pc levy on Chinese Electric Vehicles. With the reciprocal tariffs accounted for, this is one sector that could face the maximum 245pc duty. Trump has also ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on all US critical minerals imports, which is being seen as a major escalation. The order lays bare what manufacturers, industry consultants, academics and others have long warned Washington about: that the US is overly reliant on Beijing and others for processed versions of the minerals that power its entire economy. China is a top global producer of 30 of the 50 minerals considered critical by the US Geological Survey, for example, and has been curtailing exports in recent months. Trump signed an order directing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to begin a national security review under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. That is the same law Trump used in his first term to impose 25pc global tariffs on steel and aluminum and one he used in February to launch a probe into potential copper tariffs. Asked for comment on the order, China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that “artificial interference in the supply chain violates the laws of the market economy and international trade rules.” Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping continued to call on Asian nations to unite in resisting geopolitical confrontation, unilateralism and protectionism, as he aims to consolidate ties with some of China’s closest neighbours. President Xi is in Malaysia as part of a three-nation Southeast Asian trip that includes Vietnam and Cambodia. “In the face of shocks to the current international order and economic globalisation, our two nations will stand united with other countries in the region to jointly resist the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, overcome the countercurrents of unilateralism and protectionism, and safeguard the promising prospects for development in our shared Asian home,” he said at an event with Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim. He did not directly refer to the United States in his remarks in Kuala Lumpur.

Six held over alleged HK$20m scam of Covid rescue fund,"Six people have been arrested on Thursday on suspicion of fraudulently obtaining more than HK$20 million from a government fund set up to help businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The six are three men and three women, aged between 20 and 45 years old, who are associated with four companies in the logistics, technology and media sectors.

They include a married couple, while the others are directors or employees of the companies involved.

Mok Lai-king, chief inspector at the commercial crime bureau, said the suspects had obtained the loans under the ""Special 100% Loan Guarantee Scheme"", which was introduced in 2020 to alleviate the financial pressure faced by the city's small and medium-sized enterprises.

Senior inspector Choy Kin-hang said the force will continue to follow the money trail.

Under the scheme, companies were allowed to borrow up to HK$9 million, provided their sales revenue for a specific month had decreased by at least 30 percent compared with the average of the previous three months.

The force also seized a number of bank documents, bank cards, checkbooks and mobile phones as well as electronic devices.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:33:08 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800804-20250417.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,Today,20
Labour chief vows to improve construction site safety,"Labour chief Chris Sun on Thursday pledged that the government will implement the Ombudsman’s recommendations on construction site safety as soon as possible.

A safety inspection checklist and an online platform to monitor records were among 40 recommendations the watchdog had put forward to tackle the issue. 

Speaking to reporters after attending the Construction Safety Award Presentation Ceremony, Sun said one area to be explored is the use of technology to boost safety. 

“As many people are aware, a key focus is leveraging technology. The Labour Department will begin using small drones for inspections and evidence collection in the second half of this year,” he said.  

Sun also stressed it is crucial to foster an industry-wide culture where everyone prioritises safety. 

He said authorities will intensify efforts to promote this mindset and show no mercy to those “law-breaking, fraudulent” people. 

Sun added that some suspected cases involving fraudulent practices have been referred to police for criminal investigation.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:26:58 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800805-20250417.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,Today,20
Hikes set for illegal parking and traffic fines,"Fines for illegal parking and other traffic offences are set to be increased, according to a paper submitted to the Legislative Council on Thursday.

In it, transport officials indicate that parking fines – which have remained unchanged for more than three decades – should rise from HK$320 to HK$400.

To increase turnover of parking spaces, metered parking rates will double to HK$4 per 15 minutes, making the hourly charge HK$16.

Officials said the hike in parking fees alone is expected to bring in an extra HK$220 million in revenue for this financial year.

Other traffic violations such as speeding, crossing double white lines and using phones while driving will see fines increase by 50 percent from between HK$320 and HK$1,000 to between HK$480 and HK$1,500. Offences like driving in excess of the speed limit by 15 km/h or less or driving with an expired licence presently bring fines of HK$320. 

Authorities also proposed a five-tier system for electric car licence fees based on a vehicle’s rated power, with annual fees ranging from HK$1,500 to HK$11,000.

The adjustments will happen gradually over three years and cost less than regular car licences to encourage people to buy electric vehicles. 

The government hopes to table the amendments to Legco in the second quarter. 

Lawmakers will discuss the proposals in a transport panel meeting next week. 

Once approved, these changes will take effect within three to six months.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:06:35 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800790-20250417.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,Today,20
National security push in runup to anniversary of law,"Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said on Thursday a series of seminars and exhibitions on national security will be launched as the city marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the national security law on June 30.

Her remarks came after the SAR held various activities, including flag-raising ceremonies and forums, marking the 10th National Security Education Day on Tuesday. 

Speaking in an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Mak said more than 10 themed activities, including seminars, exhibitions and sports galas, will be held between May and July to further raise public awareness of national security.

She added that a national security education symposium will be held next month that will see experts interact with various groups such as the elderly, ethnic minorities and youths. 

The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, she said, will continue to promote exchanges between SAR youths and their mainland and global peers.

In 2024-25, internship and exchange activities for youngsters cover 48 countries spanning across six continents, 34 nations of which are in ""Belt and Road"" regions, Mak said.

An official commemoration ceremony, meanwhile, will be held on September 3 at the Memorial Garden of the Hong Kong City Hall to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, during which veteran soldiers will share their experiences.

Mak added that the bureau will subsidise 2,000 youths for visits to military facilities, historic sites and museums on the mainland in the second half of 2025 to deepen their understanding of national defence and national security.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:59:10 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800760-20250417.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,Today,20
Looming hike in illegal parking fine 'relatively mild',"A lawmaker said on Thursday a possible increment in illegal parking fines is ""relatively mild"".

Chan Siu-hung made the remarks on an RTHK radio programme after a source revealed that motorists might be fined HK$400 for illegal parking, up from the current HK$320.

It is believed that the cost of metered parking spaces could double to HK$4 for every 15 minutes, while the penalty for speeding and other traffic infringements could also cost 50 percent more.

Traffic fines have remained unchanged for more than three decades.

Chan, who also chairs the transport panel in the Legislative Council, pointed out that illegal parking fines in countries and places such as Singapore, London and Australia cost 10 times more than the SAR.

He said the possible increment of HK$80 is relatively mild.

""For so many years, the fine has remained at HK$320,"" Chan said. 

""If it's increased to HK$400, as rumours suggest, that would be just a mild increment.

""If you compare that increase to the rise in inflation, or as a way to achieve fiscal balance for public services, an increment of HK$320 to HK$400 isn't welcome, but the rate is relatively mild.""

The lawmaker also said that the absence of more effective deterrent measures for speeding and other traffic violations would affect safety for other road users and cause economic losses. 

Speaking on the same show, Ho Chi-keung from the taxi division of the Motor Transport Workers General Union, questioned if the possible increment could be reduced due to the poor state of the economy.

He emphasised that drivers do not wish to park illegally but may be forced to because Hong Kong lacks parking spaces.

Ho hopes law enforcement workers can be more lenient, such as by waiting for a few minutes before issuing a ticket, if they know that drivers are using washrooms nearby.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:08:10 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800753-20250417.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,Today,20
Police warn of surge in online shopping fraud,"Police on Thursday expressed concern about an increase in online shopping fraud, despite overall technology crimes dipping slightly last year. 

There were 11,559 cases involving online shopping fraud last year - a more than 29 percent year-on-year increase, with losses almost doubling to nearly HK$360 million. 

Scams linked to Facebook alone accounted for more than 40 percent of the cases. Officers said scammers had created social media pages with fake reviews and comments to trick people into making purchases. 

Superintendent Baron Chan of the Cyber Security Division said changing shopping habits also contributed to the spike in cases. 

“In the past, citizens may not be interested in trading some luxury products with quite a high amount of value,” he said.  

“But in recent years, even some very high amount, expensive products, they would trade in online platforms, for example, watches and even involving some exchange of currency and cryptocurrency.” 

Major events have also become a target with shows and concerts returning to the city. Over 15 percent of last year’s online shopping scams involved fake tickets sale, Chan noted. 

The force added that phishing links to steal banking information and bounced cheques were two other common tactics used by bad actors. 

Chan shared these tips to avoid scams. 

“First of all, for all buyers, they should deal with some reputable sellers. For the best interests of all, they should choose to have the trading or money transaction in person. 

“Secondly, especially for some concert tickets or big event tickets, they should buy the ticket through some official channels. 

“Whenever trading involving cheques, citizens should pay attention to the available balance instead of the current or ledger balance,” he said.  

Overall, there were 33,903 tech crime cases last year, a less than one percent decrease compared to 2023.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 05:55:08 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800706-20250417.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,Today,20
"Parking, traffic tickets could soon cost more: source","Motorists may soon have to pay HK$400 for an illegal parking ticket, a 25 percent increase, while metered parking spaces could cost HK$4 per 15 minutes, double the current rate, according to an RTHK source.

RTHK has also learnt that fines for speeding and other traffic infringements could cost 50 percent more, as the government aims to improve road safety and enforcement efficiency.

The final proposal is expected to be unveiled next week.

In a Facebook post published on Wednesday, the Transport and Logistics Bureau pointed out that the fixed penalties for traffic contraventions have remained unchanged for over three decades.

The fines were ""significantly lower"" than other regions in the world, the bureau added, citing examples in Singapore, London and the Australian state of New South Wales.

It also noted a rise in dangerous behaviour such as speeding, not following road markings, and using mobile phones while driving, suggesting a need to raise fines to create a greater deterrent effect.

Authorities also believe bumping up metered parking charges would deter drivers from circling the streets to look for a space. 

Officials have at the same time pledged to increase off-street parking to cater to growing demand.

Meanwhile, owners of private electric cars could see the cost of driving go up further, as the bureau is looking to increase their licence fees.

In a separate Facebook post, the bureau noted owners of such vehicles on average pay around HK$1,100 per year, compared to HK$7,500 for those who own private cars with internal combustion engines.

The bureau is proposing a five-tier fee structure based on the vehicle’s rated power, and the adjustment will be implemented in phases over three years.

The proposals will be discussed at the Legislative Council’s transport panel on April 25.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 17:17:32 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800648-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20
Support measures urged for SMEs amid trade war,"Legislators from the Business and Professionals Alliance (BPA) on Wednesday urged the government to roll out support measures for Hong Kong's business sector amid the ongoing trade war.

The lawmakers said authorities should help companies obtain financing from banks and keep up with their cashflow, such as by allowing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to defer loan repayments.

Jeffrey Lam said the sector is having a hard time.

""Some people are thinking of moving their production facilities out of Hong Kong into Asean countries,"" he said. 

""But it's not easy. They need to find land or a factory space, then equip it with their machines, train people.

""It will take months... So what's everybody going to do during this time when the factory is setting up, paying a high price for merchandise? It is not fair to the people.""

Lam said SMEs are the ""lifeline"" of Hong Kong's economy and important driving forces of economic growth in the SAR.

The lawmakers said the government should also work harder to attract foreign companies to Hong Kong, which includes setting up a fund to provide grants to leading enterprises.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 17:09:15 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800646-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20
Govt urged to beef up penalties for animal cruelty,"Animal welfare groups on Wednesday urged the government to beef up penalties for animal cruelty and make Hong Kong a more pet-friendly city. 

At a press conference at the Legislative Council, the organisations said the current penalty of HK$200,000 and a jail term of three years is not enough. 

They want to increase the fine to HK$1 million and extend jail terms to seven years for a stronger deterrent effect. 

Susan Lai, founder of the Animal Rights and Welfare Association, said there are loopholes with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance.

“There is an urgent need to review the current legislation, including the addition of 'due diligence' in the legislation, and also increase the penalty regarding any animal cruelty case,” she said.

“Currently it is very difficult to provide evidence, and successful prosecution cases are actually very low.”

Despite there being nearly 500 animal cruelty cases reported in the first nine months of 2024, the prosecution rate was only three percent, official figures showed.

North District councillor Corey Lau said authorities should also review restrictions for pets in restaurants and expand their access to public transport. 

“The demand is very high in Hong Kong because many pet owners want to transport and eat with their pets in the restaurants. That's why there's a demand for the improvement of the law,” he said.

DAB lawmaker Edward Lau will meet officials from the Environment and Ecology Bureau to discuss these proposals later this month.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 16:42:21 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800640-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20

Speaking to RTHK, Tang said people in Hong Kong, especially entrepreneurs, should prioritise national security over development, and they simply could not just focus on development and overlook national security.

The FTU lawmaker said the speech by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office also emphasised the importance of remembering past events and remaining vigilant in times of peace.

Tang also said Xia called for a clear recognition of the current situation and an understanding of the pressure facing China and the SAR.

Electronic ticketing system set for driving offences,"Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Wednesday that an electronic regime of fixed-penalty tickets is expected to be implemented on June 15 in an attempt to increase the overall efficiency of traffic enforcement.

She also said a new thematic portal and mobile application for electronic traffic enforcement will be introduced, enabling vehicle owners and drivers to verify and view tickets online and make payments for penalties via electronic means.

""The aim of digitalisation of traffic fixed penalty tickets is, in line with the direction of developing Hong Kong into a smart city, to increase the overall efficiency of traffic enforcement through the application of technology, improving the accuracy and speeding up the turnaround in the process of inputting, recording and retrieving information in relation to traffic offences or contraventions committed by offenders,"" she wrote in a written reply to the Legislative Council.

She said the full implementation of the measure is estimated to save around HK$12.4 million a year as well as about HK$232 million notional savings in manpower through redeployment of staff to other traffic management duties.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 13:36:52 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800611-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20
Ombudsman urges construction checks be stepped up,"Ombudsman Jack Chan said on Wednesday the government should step up inspections to ensure the construction sector carries out safety checks thoroughly.

The call came after the Office of the Ombudsman completed a direct investigation operation into the enforcement of government regulations on occupational safety in the construction sector.

It made 40 recommendations to the Labour Department, the Buildings Department and the Development Bureau. 

Chan said some examiners had not carried out any inspections before certifying the safety of equipment, such as lifting appliances and bamboo scaffolds.

He said the government should formulate an inspection checklist and set up an electronic platform for the sector to upload inspection records to facilitate monitoring. 

“We recommend the Labour Department require these examiners or certified persons to fill in a checklist… when they're checking the safety of these operations or appliances,” he said.

“We propose to have a platform for these examiners to [upload] the examination records so that [they] could be easily checked by the Labour Department, and also make sure that they cannot fill in the form in advance because it's a real-time electronic platform.“

Chan said authorities should review the operational guidelines to select high-risk construction sites more precisely for in-depth surprise inspections. 

He also urged the Buildings Department to set up a mechanism to ensure timely follow-ups on cases referred to it by the Labour Department involving contractors who had been convicted of occupational safety and health offences.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 13:11:45 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800615-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20
Frustration up over postal stop to US-bound parcels,"Some locals have been left frustrated by Hongkong Post's announcement on Wednesday that it has suspended surface parcel deliveries to the United States with immediate effect.

The move is made due to the longer shipping time required to deliver small parcels sent by surface mail in time to avoid the US tariffs that are coming into effect from May 2, given that Hongkong Post ""will definitely not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US"".

Air delivery services will also be suspended starting from April 27.

However, postal items that only contain documents are not affected.

Freda Cheung, who runs an online business that often requires her to send airmail parcels to the United States, said the move will greatly affect her.

""I don't think I will use other courier services because the tax is too high for me,"" she told RTHK.

""So I will reject all US-bound packages.""

Cheung said she will adopt a wait-and-see approach for now, adding that she might consider marketing for other countries like the ones in Europe.

Another resident, Chan, said he felt powerless, even though he only occasionally sends parcels to a friend in the United States.

""With the US imposing tariffs, there's nothing we can do as Hong Kong has to abide by it too,"" he said. 

""There's nothing we can change.

""I'll still pay the tariffs. There's no other way.""

A man, Yeung, who sometimes sends parcel to his US relatives, said he will consider using international shipping companies.

However, he will only do so when there is an urgent need as he will have to pay more.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:52:36 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800602-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20
Errant drivers to be brought to book in pilot scheme,"Police announced on Wednesday a new pilot programme to monitor traffic violations at four locations using security cameras starting on Tuesday, with the aim of enhancing road safety and enforcement efficiency.

The initiative will leverage the Transport Department’s existing traffic control and surveillance system, including CCTV systems, to detect unsafe driving.

Fixed penalty notices will be issued to offenders once drivers are identified through captured licence plate details and timestamps of violations.

The superintendent of traffic management at the traffic branch headquarters, Nip Hoi-kwan, said the programme expands enforcement capabilities.

""In the past, the Transport Department's traffic control and surveillance system did not have video recording capabilities,"" Nip said. 

""The purpose of this plan is simply to provide officers with an additional enforcement option.

""Based on traffic conditions or their experience, officers will assess when congestion is likely to be more serious, and during those times, personnel will be sent to the control centre to monitor the traffic situation and activate the recording function.""

The first phase targets Queen’s Road Central's intersections with Ice House Street, Pedder Street and Bonham Strand as well as the Queen's Road East intersection with Wong Nai Chung Road.

The superintendent of the enforcement and control division of traffic Hong Kong Island, Mak Chung-kit, said these sites were chosen due to recurring violations and their disproportionate impact on broader traffic flow.

""In the past, we have continuously deployed our officers, whether for patrolling, law enforcement or directing traffic, and have invested a significant amount of manpower and resources,"" Mak said.

""However, traffic violations and congestion at the affected locations often reoccur shortly after our officers leave. 

""We found that the effectiveness of our officers' presence is very short-lived.

""At these four locations, traffic violations such as illegal parking, illegal pick-ups and drop-offs or yellow box junction obstructions can cause congestion that, even in a very short period of time, will impact nearby major roads and even affect trunk roads.""

The police said the aim is to bolster public compliance with traffic laws, reduce accident risks and alleviate congestion through sustained monitoring.

The three-month pilot will undergo a review before potential expansion, with outcomes informing future enforcement strategies.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:53:09 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800578-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20
"HK eyes e-commerce, silver economy amid challenges","Hong Kong needs to seek new growth opportunities amid global uncertainties, such as developing e-commerce and the silver economy, says Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau. 

Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Yau said geopolitical challenges and supply-chain disruptions are affecting the city's economy.

""Under these circumstances, Hong Kong must seek new ways forward,"" he said. 

""There are many good examples, such as the chief executive leading multiple visits to the Middle East and Asean countries.""

While the SAR has traditionally relied on trade with Europe and the United States, there is a need to seek new economic partnerships to mitigate geopolitical influences, Yau said. 

Noting the mainland's impressive e-commerce transaction volumes last year, he said online shopping is one key area that Hong Kong can tap into. 

Yau said a shopping festival held in August attracted a good response from the mainland, with 230 brands participating and more than 90 million impressions on discussion forums and the official website. 

The minister also highlighted the importance of developing a silver economy, noting that around one-third of Hong Kong's population – or 2.67 million people – will be over 65 years old by 2043. 

""While we need to address welfare issues for elderly people from grassroots groups, there are also many middle-class or better-off seniors who own properties and have pension funds,"" he said. 

""How can we stimulate consumption among this demographic? 

""Despite their substantial economic power, society seems to pay little attention to their spending needs,"" Yau said.

A government working group on the silver economy is focused on five areas: boosting consumption, developing the industry, promoting quality assurance, enhancing financial security and unleashing productivity.","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 10:23:40 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800565-20250416.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20
HK junior fencing team wins bronze in Wuxi,"Hong Kong, China's junior men’s epee team made history at the World Cadets and Juniors Fencing Championships in Wuxi, clinching their first-ever bronze medal in the event - a landmark achievement for the SAR. 

The quartet of Gao Ying-chuen, Kenton Hsu, Wong Chi-ho, and Yuen Nok-man stormed through the early rounds, overcoming the Netherlands, Germany and Ukraine in succession to secure a spot in the semifinals. 

Although they were stopped by Canada in their quest for gold, the team regrouped for a dramatic bronze-medal showdown against Hungary.

In a tense finale, Hong Kong narrowly edged out their rivals 45-43. 

Trailing 23-25 at halftime, Yuen turned the tide with a gritty 3-1 rally in the sixth round to level the score at 26-26. 

Wong then ignited a commanding 9-3 surge, propelling Hong Kong to a 35-29 lead and cementing their path to victory.

Italy claimed gold in the event, with Canada securing silver.

""What it means is a consumer market and source of tourists that is over 10 times as large as our own city. What it also means, with our country’s facilitation measures for travellers, is that visitors who choose to visit this part of the world have much more cities to add to their itinerary,"" Lee said.

""We are fast developing in multi-destination tourism for an interconnected world.""

HK 'is a pivotal region for I&T development',"An association representing global mobile operators said on Tuesday Hong Kong is a pivotal region for the development of innovation and technology and that it can learn from the mainland. 

The Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) said operators on the mainland and in Hong Kong are leaders in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence solutions. 

Speaking after the Asia-Pacific Summit of the World Internet Conference, association chief executive and director John Hoffman said Hong Kong should make use of its development centres and talent to further promote AI development.

""[The companies] are leading in many aspects of not only the development of AI through companies like DeepSeek and others that are pushing the boundaries of AI, but then to turn around and implement them in a way that it benefits society,"" he said.

""It's not technology for technology's sake, but it's technology for the betterment of industry, businesses, government and of course society.""

Hoffman said the mainland has some of the largest mobile operators in the world and Hong Kong should make use of its proximity to the mainland to learn from the firms.

""I think Hong Kong has proven in the past that it's a place of export,"" he said. 

""It's a place where others can learn from... Hong Kong must seize that opportunity to learn from the mainland, then adapt and modify to its local conditions.

""Hopefully the rest of the world can look to Hong Kong and say 'This is a great solution. Let me try something similar'.""

The Digital Policy Office on Tuesday released guidelines on the application of generative AI, aiming to facilitate the safe and responsible use of AI by the industry and the public.

Hoffman said guidelines on the use of AI must be localised but stressed that they should be established under a framework that allows innovation to further develop.","Tue, 15 Apr 2025 18:35:07 +0800",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800495-20250415.htm,RTHK News,Hong Kong,en,This Week,20

"UN nuclear chief says Iran, US running out of time to secure deal","TEHRAN : UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Thursday that Iran and the United States were running out of time to secure a deal as they prepare to hold fresh nuclear talks this weekend. Iranian and US delegations are to gather in Rome on Saturday for a second round of Omani-mediated negotiations, a week after the longtime foes held their highest-level talks since US President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear accord in 2018. “We are in a very crucial stage of these important negotiations. We know we don’t have much time, this is why I am here ... to facilitate this process,“ Grossi said on a visit to Tehran. “We are working hard and we want to succeed,“ he told a joint news conference with Iran’s atomic energy agency chief Mohammad Eslami, acknowledging that the search for a deal was “not an easy process”. On Wednesday, Grossi met with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the first round of talks with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday. Araghchi said he had a “useful” meeting with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief. “The IAEA can play a crucial role in peaceful settlement of the Iranian nuclear file in the coming months,“ he said. Araghchi called on the IAEA chief to “keep the agency away from politics” in the face of “spoilers” seeking to “derail current negotiations”. He did not elaborate. ‘Not far’ from possessing bomb Before heading to Iran, Grossi told French newspaper Le Monde that Tehran was “not far” from possessing a nuclear bomb. Western governments have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition Tehran has consistently denied. A year after Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran began rolling back its own commitments under the agreement, which gave it relief from sanctions in return for IAEA-monitored restrictions on its nuclear activities. In its latest report, the IAEA said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilogrammes (605 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent. That level far exceeds the 3.67 percent enrichment ceiling set by the 2015 deal, but still falls short of the 90 percent threshold required for a nuclear warhead. Since he returned to office in January, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” policy of punishing economic sanctions against Iran. In March, he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refused. On Thursday, the New York Times reported that Trump had blocked an Israeli plan to strike Iranian nuclear facilities in favour of seeking a negotiated deal. ‘Conflicting positions’ On Tuesday, Khamenei cautioned that while the talks with the United States had started well, they could yet prove fruitless. “The negotiations may or may not yield results,“ he said. On Wednesday, Araghchi said Iran’s enrichment of uranium was not up for discussion after Witkoff called for a halt. Witkoff had previously demanded only that Iran return to the 3.67 percent enrichment ceiling set by the 2015 deal. Araghchi said he hoped to start negotiations on the framework of a possible agreement, but that this required “constructive positions” from the United States. “If we continue to (hear) contradictory and conflicting positions, we are going to have problems,“ he warned. On Thursday, Iran’s top diplomat was in Moscow on a “pre-planned” visit to the Tehran ally. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Araghchi would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin later in the day. “Our regular exchanges with Russia and China have allowed us to align our positions,“ Araghchi said on his arrival in the Russian capital. Meanwhile, the official Saudi Press Agency reported that Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman had travelled to Tehran for talks on Thursday. During his first term, Trump attempted to forge an alliance between Israel and the Gulf Arab states against Iran. But in 2023 Tehran and Riyadh restored ties in a Chinese-brokered rapprochement, while the outbreak of the Gaza war later the same year soured relations between all Arab states and Israel.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:32:38 GMT",https://thesun.my/world-news/un-nuclear-chief-says-iran-us-running-out-of-time-to-secure-deal-FN13964735,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
China ready to share rare earth processing technology with Malaysia,"TAPAH : China is ready to share its rare earth processing technology with Malaysia - a move that could substantially boost the commodity’s value in the global market.

"Anwar, Paetongtarn reaffirm ASEAN’s collective stand on US tariffs","BANGKOK : Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his Thai counterpart, Paetongtarn Shinawatra have reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the issue of United States (US) tariffs collectively at the ASEAN level. Anwar, currently on a two-day working visit to Thailand, said delegations from both Malaysia and Thailand discussed the matter during their bilateral meeting. “We also deliberated on the issue of US tariffs and reaffirmed our commitment to addressing it collectively at the ASEAN level through a fair and sustainable negotiation framework,” he said during the bilateral meeting with Paetongtarn at Government House here today. Anwar expressed his appreciation to the Thai prime minister for her commitment to strengthening bilateral ties. “I value the Thai government’s willingness to continue advancing existing agreements, particularly those aimed at enhancing the economies of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand. “With Thailand now Malaysia’s sixth-largest trading partner, and total trade exceeding US$25 billion last year, these initiatives will help us achieve our US$30 billion target by 2027,” he said. Earlier, Anwar and Paetongtarn witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) concerning the construction agreement (CA) for the Rantau Panjang-Sungai Golok Bridge Project. Meanwhile in a press conference, Paetongtarn said three main topics were discussed with Anwar: the Sungai Golok Bridge project, peace in Thailand’s southern provinces, and US tariffs. Regarding the Sungai Golok Bridge, she said construction is ongoing and is expected to be completed on schedule. “As for peace in southern Thailand, we sought Malaysia’s cooperation, with a primary focus on economic development. This includes initiatives such as halal food production and the Rubber City project. “We agreed on transforming the ‘battlefield’ into a ‘trade field’ to promote cooperation and mutual economic benefits,” she said. Paetongtarn also noted that both leaders discussed how ASEAN member states could respond collectively to US tariffs. “ASEAN has a large population and significant potential if we act in unison. We also explored the different strategies that each country is adopting and agreed that every nation would proceed with its respective approach,” she said.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:23:51 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/anwar-paetongtarn-reaffirm-asean-s-collective-stand-on-us-tariffs-MN13964679,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
"Malaysia, China deepen ties with new giant panda conversation deal","PUTRAJAYA : The signing of a new agreement for the International Cooperation Project on Giant Panda Conservation will enable Malaysia to receive a new pair of Giant Pandas for the next 10 years. Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said the joint endeavor symbolises the collaborative project between China and Malaysia, and promotes conservation diplomacy, consistent with Malaysia MADANI’s values of global collaboration in sustainability initiatives. “I hope that the giant pandas, who are special envoys from China, can further promote understanding and close cooperation between the two countries. “Malaysia will continue to be committed to working with China for the conservation and enhancement of scientific cooperation in the preservation of the iconic wildlife species, the giant panda,” he said in a statement today. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and China’s President Xi Jinping on Wednesday witnessed the exchange of 31 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and documents covering various sectors of cooperation between the two countries. Among them was the new agreement for the International Cooperation Project on Giant Panda Conservation, which was signed by the Director-General of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (PERHILITAN) of Peninsular Malaysia Datuk Abdul Kadir Abu Hashim and the Secretary-General of China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA) Yan Jian. Malaysia, through a previous agreement signed on June 15, 2012, was granted a conservation cooperation project with a pair of giant pandas for 10 years, housed at the Giant Panda Conservation Centre, Zoo Negara. During this period, Malaysia has shown extraordinary achievements in the ex-situ conservation of giant pandas with the breeding and birth of three giant panda cubs. All three giant panda cubs have been returned to China in compliance with the terms of the agreement. Nuan Nuan, who was born on Aug 8, 2015, Yi Yi (Jan 14, 2018) and Sheng Yi on May 30, 2021 are the cubs of the giant panda couple Fu Wa and Feng Yi who were renamed Xing Xing and Liang Liang. Nuan Nuan was sent back to China in 2017, while Yi Yi and Sheng Yi left Malaysia on Aug 29, 2023. The panda parents were loaned to the Malaysian government in 2014 for 10 years, in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:19:58 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/malaysia-china-deepen-ties-with-new-giant-panda-conversation-deal-GN13964651,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50

Gaza rescuers say 40 mostly displaced people killed in Israeli strikes,"GAZA CITY : Gaza’s civil defence agency said Thursday that a rash of Israeli air strikes killed at least 40 people, most of them in encampments for displaced civilians, as Israel pressed its offensive in the Palestinian territory. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the strikes, which came as Hamas officials reported that internal deliberations on the latest Israeli truce offer were nearly complete. Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said two Israeli missiles hit several tents in the Al-Mawasi area of the southern city of Khan Yunis, resulting in at least 16 deaths, “most of them women and children, and 23 others were wounded”. After Israel declared Al-Mawasi a safe zone in December 2023, tens of thousands of Palestinians flocked there seeking refuge from bombardment, but the area has since been hit by repeated Israeli strikes. Survivors described a large explosion at the densely packed encampment that set multiple tents ablaze. “We were sitting peacefully in the tent, under God’s protection, when we suddenly saw something red glowing -- and then the tent exploded, and the surrounding tents caught fire,“ Israa Abu al-Rus told AFP. “This is supposed to be a safe area in Al-Mawasi,“ Abu al-Rus said. “We fled the tent towards the sea and saw the tents burning.” Bassal said that Israeli strikes on two other encampments of displaced Gazans killed a further nine people -- seven in the northern town of Beit Lahia, and a father and son near Al-Mawasi. Separately, the civil defence reported two more attacks on displaced people in Jabalia -- one that killed at least seven members of the Asaliya family, and another that killed six people at a school being used as a shelter -- as well as Israeli shelling in Gaza City that killed two. The military later announced it had carried out a strike in Jabalia on what it said was a Hamas “command and control” centre. ‘Starvation as a weapon’ Israel said Wednesday that it had converted 30 percent of Gaza into a buffer zone in the widening offensive it resumed in March, ending a two-month ceasefire. Defence Minister Israel Katz said this month that the military was leaving Gaza “smaller and more isolated”. The United Nations said half a million Palestinians have been displaced since the offensive resumed, triggering what it has described as the most severe humanitarian crisis since the war began with Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The Israeli military said its air strikes had hit “approximately 1,200 terror targets” since March 18. The leader of Qatar, which along with Egypt and the US helped mediate the January ceasefire deal, blamed Israel on Thursday for its collapse. “As you know, we reached an agreement months ago, but unfortunately Israel did not abide by this agreement,“ said Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani during a visit to Moscow. Qatar would continue to “strive to bridge perspectives in order to reach an agreement that ends the suffering of the Palestinian people”, he added. Acknowledging Qatar’s efforts, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the war in Gaza “a tragedy”, saying a long-term resolution was “connected to the establishment of two states”, Palestinian and Israeli. New truce offer Hamas accused Israel on Thursday of attempting to starve Gaza’s 2.4 million people after Katz said the day before that Israel would continue preventing aid from entering the territory. “This is a public admission of committing a war crime, including the use of starvation as a weapon and the denial of basic necessities such as food, medicine, water, and fuel to innocent civilians for the seventh consecutive week,“ the group said in a statement. During an impasse over the future of the ceasefire, Israel halted the entry of aid on March 2, exacerbating the territory’s ongoing humanitarian crisis. In parallel to the Gaza offensive, Hamas said Israel had proposed a new 45-day ceasefire through mediators that would include the release of dozens of hostages. The proposal also called for Hamas to disarm to secure a complete end to the war, a demand the group rejects. Two Hamas officials said Thursday that internal discussions on the truce proposal were nearly complete, with one telling AFP “the group will send its response to the mediators once they finish” -- possibly on Thursday. Israel’s renewed assault has so far killed at least 1,691 people in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory reported, bringing the overall toll since the war erupted to 51,065, most of them civilians. Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, also mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:07:39 GMT",https://thesun.my/world-news/gaza-rescuers-say-40-mostly-displaced-people-killed-in-israeli-strikes-PN13964597,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
Jalur Gemilang gaffe: Police wrap up questioning of Sin Chew editors,"KUALA LUMPUR : Police have completed recording statements from the Chief Editor and Deputy Chief Sub-editor of the Sin Chew Daily newspaper today to assist in investigations into the publication of an incomplete illustration of the Jalur Gemilang on the newspaper’s front page. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said the process took about three hours at the Classified Crime Investigation Unit office at the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) headquarters in Bukit Aman. “The entire process was completed at 3.45 pm,” he said when contacted today. The Chief Editor was said to have approved the publication of the illustration, while the Deputy Chief Sub-editor was responsible for designing the graphic. Razarudin said so far police have received 40 reports nationwide regarding the issue. The case is being investigated under Section 3(1)(c) of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1963 and Section 4(1)(b) of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984. On Tuesday, the Chinese-language daily published an illustration of the Jalur Gemilang on its front page in conjunction with coverage of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Malaysia, but the flag appeared incomplete. The incident drew criticism from various parties, including His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, King of Malaysia, who said the newspaper’s management and editorial department must be more careful and thoroughly vet materials before publication. Following the backlash, the newspaper issued an apology, stating that the mistake was a technical error and unintentional.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:58:18 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/jalur-gemilang-gaffe-police-wrap-up-questioning-of-sin-chew-editors-DN13964564,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
Report on Sarawak wanting to buy AmBank stake mere speculation - Abang Johari,"KUCHING : Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg has described the report that the state wanted to acquire a stake in AMMB Holdings Bhd (AmBank Group) to merge with Affin Bank Bhd as mere speculation. He also denied that Sarawak had sent a state government representative to discuss the matter with the AmBank Group. “If you want to propose, you should ask her father first... but (in this context), the father doesn’t know about the matter, so how can you propose? “Jokes aside, I was surprised also when I read the report... the report is just a speculation. “I have no comment because I don’t know about that,” he told reporters when met at the RECODA Raya Rindok event organised by the Regional Corridor Development Authority (RECODA) here today. Abang Johari, however, said Sarawak is always ready to negotiate with any entity if there is one that wants to collaborate with the state government. Earlier, a report claimed that Sarawak, the largest shareholder of Affin Bank, was in talks with AmBank Group to merge the two banks. The report also claimed that Sarawak had contacted AmBank founder Tan Sri Azman Hashim and expressed interest in buying his stake in the group.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:55:25 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/report-on-sarawak-wanting-to-buy-ambank-stake-mere-speculation-abang-johari-CN13964521,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
"Woman loses RM30,200 to online job scam","KUALA TERENGGANU : A 39-year-old woman lost RM30,200 to an online job scam after being lured through a WhatsApp group offering high-paying tasks. Kuala Terengganu police chief ACP Azli Mohd Noor said the victim was initially contacted on April 4 by an individual claiming she would receive a solar lamp as a gift. She was then invited to join a WhatsApp group offering commission-based tasks through an e-commerce platform. “At the start, she completed a few tasks and received payment, which convinced her the offer was genuine,” he said when contacted today. However, Azli said the victim later failed to receive further payments and was told it was due to a late submission. Hoping to get her commission, she made six transactions totalling RM30,200 to the suspect. Realising she had been duped, she lodged a police report yesterday. The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:51:36 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/woman-loses-rm30200-to-online-job-scam-DN13964474,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
"Malaysia, Thailand jointly funded cross-border bridge expected to be completed in 2028","BANGKOK : The construction of a jointly-funded second bridge and the upgrading of the existing bridge linking Rantau Panjang, Malaysia, and Sungai Kolok, Thailand, are expected to be completed by 2028. Minister of Works Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi stated that the project includes the construction of a new 117.3-metre bridge parallel to the existing one, along with comprehensive upgrades to the original structure. “With an estimated cost of RM40.54 million, the project is jointly funded by both governments and is targeted for completion in 2028,” he said in a statement here today. Earlier, Nanta and Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister cum Minister of Transport, Suriya Juangroongruangkit signed the Construction Agreement (CA) for the second bridge and the upgrading of the existing bridge. The exchange of the agreement was witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, marking the formal commencement of this major cross-border infrastructure project between Malaysia and Thailand. Nanta remarked that the signing signifies another crucial step towards fostering sustainable regional development and inclusive growth. “It aligns with Malaysia’s Chairmanship of ASEAN under the theme ‘Inclusivity and Sustainability,’ which reflects the region’s shared vision of collective progress - ensuring that development benefits all communities and no one is left behind,” he said. The minister highlighted that the collaboration demonstrates Malaysia’s commitment to fostering regional development, strengthening bilateral ties, and ensuring inclusive prosperity for border communities. Once completed, the expanded infrastructure is expected to significantly enhance connectivity, trade, and people-to-people interactions, serving as a lasting symbol of the enduring friendship between Malaysia and Thailand. For the record, in 2012, under the Joint Development Strategy (JDS) for Border Areas endorsed by the Heads of State, Malaysia’s Ministry of Works and Thailand’s Department of Highways under the Ministry of Transport agreed to expand the bridge’s capacity to meet rising demands. Malaysia subsequently took the lead in designing the new structure, drawing inspiration from the traditional “Perahu” (boat) motif, paying homage to Sungai Golok’s central role in linking Rantau Panjang in Kelantan and Su-ngai Kolok in Narathiwat.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:48:29 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/malaysia-thailand-jointly-funded-cross-border-bridge-expected-to-be-completed-in-2028-CN13964446,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50

"Tengku Zafrul bertemu wakil perdagangan AS, pegawai di Washington pada 24 April","KUALA LUMPUR : Menteri Pelaburan, Perdagangan dan Industri Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz dijadualkan bertemu Wakil Perdagangan Amerika Syarikat (USTR) Jamieson Greer dan pegawai lain yang berkaitan di Washington pada 24 April, untuk membincangkan tarif balas yang telah dikenakan ke atas Malaysia. “Kami akan bertemu USTR dan pegawai kerajaan lain daripada pentadbiran Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump dalam lawatan saya selama dua hari,” katanya. Delegasi Malaysia juga akan mengambil peluang untuk bertemu beberapa dewan perniagaan, syarikat dan kumpulan berkepentingan bagi menerangkan pendirian dan situasi negara serta maklum balas yang diterima daripada Kabinet, kata Tengku Zafrul dalam taklimat media baru-baru ini. “Kami perlu ke sana untuk menjelaskan bagaimana Malaysia, sebuah negara neutral memainkan peranan penting dalam sektor semikonduktor serta elektrik dan elektronik. Matlamat kami untuk menunjukkan bahawa Malaysia boleh menyokong industri di AS berbanding memberi ancaman kepada mereka,” katanya. Beliau akan diiringi Timbalan Ketua Setiausaha (Perdagangan) Kementerian Pelaburan, Perdagangan dan Industri (MITI) Mastura Ahmad Mustafa serta pegawai lain dari kementerian. Wakil MITI di Kedutaan Malaysia di Washington akan menyertai delegasi itu. Tengku Zafrul menjelaskan perjalanan itu bukan untuk rundingan tetapi perbincangan. “Kami tidak pergi ke sana untuk membincangkan butiran rundingan. Rundingan mengambil masa, bukan? Oleh itu, ia lebih kepada berbincang mengenai bagaimana Malaysia boleh memainkan peranan penting dalam rantaian bekalan antara Asia dan AS,” katanya. Walaupun lawatan ini untuk Malaysia, Tengku Zafrul berkata beliau juga akan mengambil peluang untuk menyatakan pendirian ASEAN mengenai isu tarif tersebut terutamanya hasil daripada mesyuarat khas Menteri-Menteri Ekonomi ASEAN. “Berdasarkan Malaysia sebagai pengerusi ASEAN, saya juga akan menjelaskan pendirian ASEAN iaitu kami mempercayai sistem perdagangan global berasaskan peraturan, merupakan prinsip multilateralisme  dalam perdagangan,” katanya. ASEAN dan Malaysia telah menyatakan dengan jelas bahawa mereka tidak akan mengambil sebarang tindakan balas. “Kami juga ingin menerangkan kepada AS bahawa ramai di antara kami, termasuk ASEAN sendiri, tidak berasakan (dakwaan) bahawa kami telah mengenakan tarif yang begitu tinggi ke atas produk AS. Kami ingin memperbetul beberapa pandangan yang salah,” katanya. Dalam kenyataan bersama yang dikeluarkan selepas mesyuarat khas itu pada 10 April, para menteri berkata ASEAN akan terlibat dalam dialog yang jujur dan konstruktif dengan AS untuk menangani kebimbangan berkaitan perdagangan. Para menteri berkata ASEAN kekal komited untuk melindungi kepentingan ekonomi blok ini serta mengekalkan hubungan perdagangan yang kukuh dan saling memberi manfaat dengan AS. Negara anggota Indo-China ASEAN merupakan yang paling teruk terkesan ekoran tarif ini, dengan Kemboja menghadapi gabungan tarif asas dan tarif balas sebanyak 49 peratus, diikuti Laos (48 peratus), Vietnam (46 peratus) dan Myanmar (44 peratus). Thailand dikenakan tarif 36 peratus, Indonesia 32 peratus, Brunei dan Malaysia, masing-masing 24 peratus, Filipina 17 peratus manakala Singapura dengan tarif asas 10 peratus. Tarif balas tersebut kini dalam tempoh penangguhan selama 90 hari, kecuali bagi China.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:36:22 GMT",https://thesun.my/cerita/berita/tengku-zafrul-bertemu-wakil-perdagangan-as-pegawai-di-washington-pada-24-april-GN13964332,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,id,Today,50
DBKL diberi empat bulan laksana pemutihan peniaga tanpa lesen - Dr Zaliha,"KUALA LUMPUR : Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL) diberi tempoh empat bulan untuk melaksanakan pemutihan menyeluruh peniaga tidak berlesen atau dikenali sebagai peniaga ‘rambo’ di ibu kota. Menteri di Jabatan Perdana Menteri (Wilayah Persekutuan) Datuk Seri Dr Zaliha Mustafa berkata ia merupakan antara pendekatan untuk melestarikan peniaga, khususnya peniaga kecil-kecilan dan penjaja untuk mendapatkan lesen. “Kita (DBKL) akan benarkan hingga Ogos ini untuk semua peniaga yang tiada lesen tampil dan berurusan dengan kita untuk mendaftar serta mendapatkan lesen berniaga di sekitar Kuala Lumpur. Kita ada pelbagai jenis lesen sebenarnya, bergantung kepada keperluan masing-masing, insya-Allah kita akan membantu dari sudut itu. “Kena faham, tidak semua kita boleh berikan lesen, ada pertimbangannya. DBKL perlu melihat kepada keseluruhan ekosistem penjaja dan cadangkan penyelesaian yang lebih strategik, bukan hanya berasaskan status quo sahaja,” katanya selepas program Semarak Aidilfitri di Dataran DBKL di sini hari ini. Dr Zaliha berkata pada masa ini pihaknya tidak mempunyai jumlah peniaga tidak berlesen, namun berharap langkah pemutihan itu dapat memberikan data dan pemetaan dalam isu itu. Beliau berkata walaupun seseorang penjaja itu mendapat lesen, mereka perlu mematuhi peraturan dan tidak bermakna mereka bebas berniaga di mana-mana kawasan sehingga membahayakan keselamatan orang lain. “Contohnya, di kawasan terbuka dan ramai orang, kita tidak boleh benarkan menjual bahan-bahan yang mungkin mudah meletup seperti belon yang ada hidrogen. Ia sangat bahaya,” katanya. Mengulas mengenai trend trak makanan dan gerai di kaki lima, beliau berkata pihaknya akan memperhalusi prosedur seperti memastikan ada ruang pejalan kaki, mewartakan sesuatu kawasan untuk tujuan berkenaan atau dibenarkan beroperasi pada waktu-waktu tertentu sahaja. Beliau turut meminta peniaga dan orang ramai untuk menjaga adab dan memberikan kerjasama kepada pihak berkuasa ketika menjalankan tugas mereka. Terdahulu, Dr Zaliha dan Datuk Bandar Kuala Lumpur Datuk Seri Dr Maimunah Mohd Sharif menyampaikan sumbangan zakat berupa wang tunai RM200 kepada 500 orang asnaf termasuk anak-anak yatim, warga emas, ibu tunggal, orang kurang upaya dan mereka yang kurang kemampuan, manakala 500 lagi dijangka menerima bantuan itu secara berperingkat. Bantuan sejumlah RM200,000 itu adalah sumbangan wang zakat daripada Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:32:03 GMT",https://thesun.my/cerita/berita/dbkl-diberi-empat-bulan-laksana-pemutihan-peniaga-tanpa-lesen-dr-zaliha-DN13964304,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,id,Today,50

"Tengku Zafrul to meet US trade rep, officials in Washington on April 24 to discuss tariffs","KUALA LUMPUR : Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI), Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz is set to meet United States Trade Representative (USTR), Jamieson Greer and other relevant officials in Washington on April 24, to discuss the reciprocal tariff imposed on Malaysia. “We will be meeting the USTR as well as other government officials from US President Donald Trump’s administration during my two-day visit,” he said. The Malaysian delegation will also take the opportunity to meet some chambers, companies and interest groups to explain the country’s stand and situation as well as the feedback received from the Cabinet, Tengku Zafrul said in a recent press briefing. “We need to go there to explain how Malaysia, as a neutral country, plays an important role in the semiconductor and electrical and electronics sectors. Our goal is to show that Malaysia can support industries in the US rather than posing a threat to them,” he emphasised. The minister will be accompanied by the MITI deputy secretary-general (trade) Mastura Ahmad Mustafa, as well as other officials from the ministry. MITI’s representatives at Malaysia’s Embassy in Washington will join the delegation. The Minister clarified that the trip is not for negotiation but discussion. “We are not going there to discuss the details of negotiation. Negotiation takes time, right? So, it is more to talk about how Malaysia can play an important role in the supply chain between Asia and the US,” Tengku Zafrul said. Although this visit is purely for Malaysia, Tengku Zafrul said he will also take the opportunity to reiterate ASEAN’s stand on the tariff issue, especially the outcome of the special ASEAN Economic Ministers’ meeting. “As Malaysia is ASEAN chair, I will also explain ASEAN’s position as well, which is, we believe in the rule-based global trading system, which is the principles of multilateralism when it comes to trade,” he said. ASEAN and Malaysia have clearly stated that they will not take any retaliatory measures. “We also all want to explain to the US that many of us, ASEAN itself, do not believe that we have imposed such high tariffs on US products. We want to correct some of the wrong views,” Tengku Zafrul said. In a joint statement issued after the special meeting on April 10,  ASEAN said it will engage in a frank and constructive dialogue with the US to address trade-related concerns. The ministers said the grouping remains committed to safeguarding ASEAN’s economic interests as well as maintaining strong and mutually beneficial trade relations with the US. ASEAN’s Indochina member states were the hardest hit by the tariffs, with Cambodia facing combined baseline and retaliatory duties totalling 49 per cent, followed by Laos (48 per cent), Vietnam (46 per cent), and Myanmar (44 per cent). Thailand was subjected to tariffs of 36 per cent, Indonesia 32 per cent, Brunei and Malaysia both 24 per cent, the Philippines 17 per cent, while Singapore faced a baseline tariff of 10 per cent. The reciprocal tariffs are currently on a 90-day pause, except for China.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:54:06 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/tengku-zafrul-to-meet-us-trade-rep-officials-in-washington-on-april-24-to-discuss-tariffs-PN13964128,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
DBKL given four months to regularise unlicensed traders - Dr Zaliha,"KUALA LUMPUR : The Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) has been given four months to conduct a regularisation exercise for unlicensed traders, commonly known as ‘Rambo’ vendors, in the federal capital. Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Federal Territories) Datuk Seri Dr Zaliha Mustafa said the initiative is one of the approaches to support sustainability among traders, particularly small-scale traders and hawkers, in obtaining business licences. “We will allow until August for all unlicensed traders to come forward and register with us (DBKL) to apply for business licences in Kuala Lumpur. We offer various types of licences based on individual needs, and, insya-Allah, we are committed to assisting in this process. “However, it must be understood that not everyone can be granted a licence.  There are considerations. DBKL needs to examine the entire hawker ecosystem and propose more strategic solutions, rather than simply maintaining the status quo,“ she said after attending the Semarak Aidilfitri event at Dataran DBKL here today. Dr Zaliha said the ministry currently does not have an exact number of unlicensed traders but hopes that the regularisation exercise will help provide data and mapping on the issue. She added that even if a hawker obtains a licence, they must still adhere to the regulations, and it does not mean they can operate anywhere in a manner that jeopardises public safety. “For example, in open and crowded areas, we cannot allow the sale of potentially explosive items like hydrogen-filled balloons. They are very dangerous if not properly controlled,“ she said. Commenting on the trend of food trucks and sidewalk stalls, she said that the ministry would improve procedures such as ensuring pedestrian space, gazetting certain areas, or permitting operations only during specific hours. Meanwhile, she urged traders and the public to remain courteous and cooperative with authorities during enforcement activities. Earlier, Dr Zaliha and Kuala Lumpur Mayor Datuk Seri Dr Maimunah Mohd Sharif presented zakat donations in the form of RM200 cash to 500 asnaf recipients, including orphans, senior citizens, single mothers, persons with disabilities, and the underprivileged, with another 500 expected to receive the aid in stages.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:50:11 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/dbkl-given-four-months-to-regularise-unlicensed-traders-dr-zaliha-FN13964100,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
State govts urged to ban vape sales to curb synthetic drug abuse,"ALOR SETAR : State governments can take action by banning the sale of electronic cigarettes or vape, which are now increasingly linked to the abuse of new synthetic drugs, Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Seri Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said. He said this was following the detection of school students as young as 13 years old using vape devices containing substances mixed with drugs, which could pose a new threat to the country if not curbed. Ayob Khan said some states had already taken the initiative to ban vape sales, bringing a positive impact, and encouraged other state governments to follow suit while waiting for the federal government to draft related laws. “Some states have made that decision, meaning state governments can also impose bans, because the sale licence is under the jurisdiction of local authorities. While waiting for the federal government to enact new laws, state governments can take action, and even if not entirely comprehensive, the impact is significant. “If you ask me personally, vape is more dangerous than cigarettes. We must make efforts toward that direction because what’s worrying is that 65 per cent of vape contents contain banned substances like methamphetamine and ecstasy, both classified as poisons,” he told reporters here today. Johor has maintained a ban and has not issued any vape or electronic cigarette sales licences since Jan 1, 2016, enforcing laws prohibiting vaping and taking action against traders involved in selling such devices. Ayob Khan said all parties must work together to tackle the issue, as vape is easily manipulated by adding dangerous new drugs, which could destroy the future of the younger generation. “A recent study in Kelantan found that the youngest users of vape are aged between 13 to 17 years. The study also found that 31 per cent of users are active, seven per cent vape regularly, and 76 per cent know individuals who use vape,” he said. He said the drug fentanyl, known as the ‘zombie drug’, has also been detected in vape liquids, with effects 100 times stronger and more dangerous than morphine and 20 to 40 times stronger than heroin. Meanwhile, Ayob Khan said a drug laboratory raided by the Bukit Aman Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (JSJN) in an operation in Kedah yesterday also uncovered activities involving the processing of vape liquids and mushrooms containing drugs. In the operation, police seized 110 vape cartridges and 67 bottles of vape liquid produced in the laboratory, intended for distribution in Kedah, Penang and the Klang Valley. “The operation covered the Kuala Muda, Pendang, Kota Setar and Pokok Sena zones, with 61 individuals arrested and various types of drugs estimated to be worth RM6 million seized for further action,” he said. Ayob Khan also said that police would apply for an allocation of RM80 million from the Home Ministry to acquire new equipment to enhance the force’s capability in detecting new drugs in the country.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:43:57 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/state-govts-urged-to-ban-vape-sales-to-curb-synthetic-drug-abuse-HN13964074,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
"Negeri boleh haramkan penjualan vape, banteras penyalahgunaan dadah","ALOR SETAR : Kerajaan negeri boleh mengambil tindakan mengharamkan penjualan rokok elektronik atau vape yang kini menjurus kepada penyalahgunaan dadah sintetik baharu. Timbalan Ketua Polis Negara Datuk Seri Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay berkata perkara itu semakin membimbangkan apabila terdapat pelajar sekolah seawal usia 13 tahun dikesan menggunakan vape mengandungi bahan dicampur dadah yang jika tidak dikekang boleh menjadi ancaman baharu di negara ini. Beliau berkata terdapat negeri telah mengambil inisiatif mengharamkan penjualan vape yang membawa impak positif dan kerajaan negeri lain disaran mengikut jejak sama sementara menunggu kerajaan Persekutuan menggubal undang-undang berkaitan. “Ada sesetengah negeri ambil keputusan itu, maknanya kerajaan negeri pun boleh keluarkan larangan, sebab lesen penjualan di bawah PBT (pihak berkuasa tempatan), sementara nak tunggu kerajaan Pusat nak gubal undang-undang baharu kerajaan negeri boleh ambil tindakan walaupun tak keseluruhan tapi impaknya memang ada. “Bila tanya saya secara peribadi, vape lagi bahaya daripada rokok, kita perlu ada usaha menjurus ke arah itu kerana apa membimbangkan kita 65 peratus daripada kandungan vape ini ada bahan terlarang seperti methamphetamine dan ekstasi, ini semua bahan disenaraikan sebagai racun,” katanya kepada pemberita di sini, hari ini. Johor kekal melarang dan tidak mengeluarkan sebarang kebenaran lesen penjualan vape atau rokok elektronik di negeri itu sejak 1 Januari 2016 serta menguatkuasakan undang-undang melarang menghisap vape termasuk mengambil tindakan terhadap peniaga yang didapati melakukan urusan jual beli peranti berkenaan. Ayob Khan menambah semua pihak perlu berusaha menangani isu itu memandangkan vape dilihat mudah dimanipulasi dengan dimasukkan dadah-dadah baharu yang berbahaya sehingga merosakkan masa depan golongan remaja. “Kajian terbaharu di Kelantan, umur paling muda terlibat vape adalah 13 hingga 17 tahun, dalam kajian itu juga didapati 31 peratus penggunanya aktif, tujuh peratus menggunakan vape secara kerap dan 76 peratus lagi kenal dengan individu yang menggunakan vape,” katanya. Menurutnya lagi, dadah jenis fentanyl yang dikenali ‘dadah zombie’ turut dikesan digunakan sebagai bahan dalam cecair vape yang kesannya 100 kali ganda berbahaya dan kuat berbanding morfin serta 20 hingga 40 kali lebih kuat daripada heroin. Dalam pada itu, makmal dadah yang diserbu Jabatan Siasatan Jenayah Narkotik (JSJN) Bukit Aman dalam Op Kenari di negeri ini semalam turut membongkar kegiatan memproses cecair vape serta mushroom yang mengandungi dadah. Katanya dalam operasi itu, pihaknya merampas 110 katrij dan 67 botol cecair vape yang dihasilkan di makmal tersebut untuk dipasarkan di negeri ini, Pulau Pinang dan Lembah Klang. “Operasi itu melibatkan Zon Kuala Muda, Pendang, Kota Setar dan Pokok Sena di mana seramai 61 orang berjaya ditahan dan pelbagai jenis dadah dianggarkan bernilai RM6 juta dirampas untuk tindakan lanjut,” katanya. Sementara itu, beliau berkata pihaknya akan memohon peruntukan RM80 juta daripada Kementerian Dalam Negeri untuk peralatan baharu dalam usaha meningkatkan keupayaan polis mengesan dadah baharu di negara ini.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:39:57 GMT",https://thesun.my/cerita/berita/negeri-boleh-haramkan-penjualan-vape-banteras-penyalahgunaan-dadah-HN13964047,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,id,Today,50
Hollywood’s fading charm in China -- and why U.S. tariffs are making it worse,"BEIJING : Once the king of China’s silver screen, Hollywood now finds itself sidelined, as local blockbusters surge and Washington’s tariffs against the rest of the world add fuel to shifting audience sentiment. According to data released this week, Chinese animated feature “Ne Zha 2” has scored a thunderous success, raking in 15.2 billion yuan (about 2.11 billion U.S. dollars) at China’s box office in just 12 weeks. In stark contrast, the top-performing American film so far this year, “A Minecraft Movie” from Warner Bros., has just crossed 150 million yuan and failed to break into China’s top 10 films of 2025. That continues a sobering trend: 2024 marked the second consecutive year in which no Hollywood title cracked the one-billion-yuan mark, a symbolic threshold once routinely surpassed. The sharp contrast highlights the deepening decline of Hollywood’s influence in the world’s second-largest movie market. Analysts say U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions are only accelerating the slide. CREATIVE DECLINE Industry data tells the story. American movies’ share of China’s annual box office revenue has plunged from 36 percent in 2018 and 30 percent in 2019 to just 14 percent in 2024, according to figures from box office tracker Maoyan, obtained by Xinhua. That fading influence extends beyond box office numbers. “American blockbusters aren’t drawing much of a crowd anymore,“ wrote one Weibo user nicknamed “SurfaceMe,“ blaming a mix of lackluster quality and declining favorability amid tariff and trade tensions. “The appeal, emotional resonance, and cultural impact of Hollywood films are fading among Chinese audiences,“ said Rao Shuguang, president of the China Film Critics Association. “Creatively, Hollywood has grown conservative, leaning too heavily on Marvel and other franchise fare. The visual spectacle remains, but viewers are experiencing aesthetic fatigue. And on a deeper level, American stories often feel disconnected from Chinese life, making it harder to generate empathy or emotional response.” According to a China Film News report, original Hollywood productions accounted for just 18.6 percent of all U.S. studio releases in 2024, a dramatic decline from 40.9 percent in 2000. In contrast, sequels, reboots, adaptations and spinoffs now account for 81.4 percent. This cost-efficient but creatively cautious model has dampened Chinese viewers’ expectations for high-quality cinematic content, it says. DWINDLING FAVORABILITY But Hollywood’s creative slump is only part of the picture. Industry insiders point to another force hastening its fall in China: the long shadow of Washington’s aggressive tariff policy and its downstream effects on public sentiment. Film is part of the broader U.S. services sector, where the United States has traditionally maintained a significant trade surplus with China. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. service exports to China grew more than eightfold between 2001 and 2023, with the annual surplus peaking at nearly 40 billion dollars. Film and other IP-driven content have long been a key part of that advantage. “U.S. politicians fixated on manufacturing trade deficits are overlooking the billions America has earned through services,“ said Ming Jinwei, a Beijing-based commentator and widely followed blogger. He warned that weaponizing tariffs could backfire by undermining America’s winning sectors. “Irrational U.S. tariffs could trigger a chain reaction, as IP-driven cultural industries are ‘cross-media, integrated and long-chained,‘” said Chen Xuguang, director of the Institute of Film, Television and Theatre at Peking University. Washington’s tariff policies risk triggering a ripple effect, with audiences drifting away from Hollywood films and potentially other U.S. cultural exports tied to major IP, he said. REPERCUSSIONS Washington’s trade restrictions and tariff escalations against China are already being felt in the reception of American cultural exports here. Franchises like Transformers, Fast & Furious and even Marvel, once guaranteed box office juggernauts, are now performing inconsistently -- or outright poorly -- in China. “It’s been rare for an American film to cross the 100 million yuan mark in China in recent years -- unless it’s something truly special,“ said Dong Wenxin, a film critic and manager of a cinema in Jinan, Shandong Province. “They’re getting beaten not just by Japanese anime but also by European arthouse and regional Asian surprises.” Tastes are shifting. Japanese animation continues to draw steady crowds, while European and Southeast Asian films are gaining ground. This year’s surprise hits, Italy’s “There’s Still Tomorrow” and Britain’s “National Theatre Live: Prima Facie,“ have exceeded expectations. Thailand’s “How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies” became a breakout sleeper last year. Looking ahead, Dong said China’s film market is likely to forge even closer ties beyond the United States to meet the increasingly diverse audience needs. And Beijing is already moving in that direction. A recent film agreement with Spain calls for deepening collaboration on co-productions, film festivals and mutual screenings, signaling that China is broadening its cultural partnerships. The irony is stark: Washington’s trade restrictions and tariff moves, designed to protect American industries, may end up crippling one of the country’s most impactful exports -- its cultural influence, analysts say. “U.S. tariffs don’t just tax goods -- they tax appeal,“ said Ming. “And in today’s global entertainment economy, once that appeal wanes, even the strongest cultural influence may have to struggle to endure.”","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:26:31 GMT",https://thesun.my/world-news/hollywood-s-fading-charm-in-china-and-why-u-s-tariffs-are-making-it-worse-DN13964007,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
King Charles III praises humanitarian workers in Easter message,"LONDON: King Charles III on Thursday paid tribute to humanitarian workers who “risk their own lives” to protect others in war-torn countries, in a message broadcast to mark Easter. “One of the puzzles of our humanity is how we are capable of both great cruelty and great kindness,“ said the British monarch, who is also head of the Anglican Church, in a message published by Buckingham Palace. “This paradox of human life runs through the Easter story and in the scenes that daily come before our eyes -- at one moment, terrible images of human suffering and, in another, heroic acts in war-torn countries where humanitarians of every kind risk their own lives to protect the lives of others,“ he added. The king, who is still receiving weekly treatment for an unspecified cancer diagnosed in early 2024, and Queen Camilla are due to attend Maundy Thursday services at Durham Cathedral in north-east England, before attending a traditional Easter Mass in Windsor on Sunday. The monarch is duty-bound to remain politically neutral, and did not mention any particular conflicts. However, his message comes at a time when the number of humanitarian workers killed reached a record high of 280 in 2024, according to the UN, as conflict rages in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine. The king also stressed the similar duty of care for strangers demanded by Judaism, Islam, “in other religious traditions and in the hearts of all those who seek the good of others”. “There are three virtues that the world still needs - faith, hope and love. And the greatest of these is love,“ he added. “It is with these timeless truths in my mind, and my heart, that I wish you all a blessed and peaceful Easter.”","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:25:24 GMT",https://thesun.my/world-news/king-charles-iii-praises-humanitarian-workers-in-easter-message-DN13963990,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
Pembukaan semula Menara KL akan dilakukan secepat mungkin - Fahmi,"KUALA LUMPUR : Menara Kuala Lumpur (Menara KL) yang ditutup sementara bermula hari ini bagi memberi laluan kepada kerja-kerja penyelenggaraan serta menyelesaikan isu berkaitan keselamatan, akan dibuka semula secepat mungkin. Menteri Komunikasi Datuk Fahmi Fadzil berkata menara komunikasi itu akan segera dibuka kepada pengunjung selepas dua aspek utama berkenaan diselesaikan oleh pemegang konsesi baharu LSH Service Master Sdn Bhd (LSHSM). “Syarikat konsesi baharu memerlukan sedikit masa untuk melaksanakan kerja-kerja berkaitan secara teliti bagi menjamin keselamatan pengunjung,” katanya yang juga jurucakap Kerajaan MADANI. Beliau berkata demikian pada sidang media mingguan di Angkasapuri di sini hari ini, yang turut dihadiri Timbalan Menteri Komunikasi Teo Nie Ching dan Ketua Setiausaha Kementerian Komunikasi Datuk Mohamad Fauzi Md Isa. Fahmi berkata pasukan Kementerian Komunikasi sudah melakukan lawatan di bangunan Menara KL baru-baru ini dan mendapati banyak perkara, antaranya perkakas di dapur restoran berputar di situ, tidak berada dalam keadaan yang ‘nyaman’ untuk pengunjung. “Selain itu terdapat juga aspek-aspek berkaitan keselamatan kepada pengunjung yang kita lihat agak merisaukan dan perlu tindakan segera, antaranya pagar penghadang (railing) di dek menara yang telah diturunkan,” katanya. Mengulas status 205 petugas syarikat konsesi lama, Menara Kuala Lumpur Sdn Bhd (MKLSB), Fahmi memaklumkan bahawa 193 daripada mereka telah bersetuju menerima tawaran bekerja semula dengan syarikat baharu LSHSM. “Berpandukan kepada notis penamatan perkhidmatan (petugas MKLSB) pada 18 Dis lepas, semua 205 pekerja itu tamat perkhidmatan pada 31 Mac lepas, bersamaan hari raya pertama. Kementerian Komunikasi telah minta syarikat baharu (LSHSM) untuk ambil semua pekerja ini kerana mereka sudah berbelas tahun bekerja di Menara KL, amat berpengalaman. “Antara syarat utama dalam tawaran kepada 205 kakitangan itu ialah LSHSM perlu menawarkan tangga gaji yang no less favourable daripada apa yang mereka perolehi dengan syarikat terdahulu,” katanya. Kementerian Komunikasi dalam kenyataan malam tadi memaklumkan Menara Kuala Lumpur akan ditutup buat sementara waktu bermula hari ini untuk memberi ruang kepada pengurusan baharu melakukan kerja-kerja penyelenggaraan serta penambahbaikan demi keselamatan dan keselesaan pengunjung.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:18:19 GMT",https://thesun.my/cerita/berita/pembukaan-semula-menara-kl-akan-dilakukan-secepat-mungkin-fahmi-ON13963962,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,id,Today,50
Tindakan Syed Saddiq arah ‘clearkan’ RM1 juta tidak jujur - Pendakwaan,"PUTRAJAYA : Mahkamah Rayuan hari ini diberitahu bahawa arahan Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman agar bekas Penolong Bendahari Angkatan Bersatu Anak Muda (Armada) Rafiq Hakim Razali ‘clearkan’ wang RM1 juta yang dikeluarkan daripada akaun Armada adalah tindakan tidak jujur. Timbalan Pendakwa Raya Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin berkata menerusi perbualan telefon, Syed Saddiq meminta Rafiq Hakim, yang merupakan saksi pendakwaan ke-13 (SP13), untuk ‘clearkan’ wang itu kerana khuatir ia akan disita oleh Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia. “Semasa disoal balas oleh peguam, SP13 bersetuju bahawa beliau menerima arahan tersebut daripada Syed Saddiq dan ketika ditanya peguam apa maksud ‘clearkan’, SP13 menjawab jangan simpan duit itu di dalam rumah saya, dan ditanya adakah ‘clear’ maksudnya ‘dispose’ (lupus), SP13 menjawab Ya,“ katanya. Beliau berkata demikian pada hari ketiga pendengaran rayuan Ahli Parlimen Muar itu terhadap sabitan dan hukuman bagi empat pertuduhan berkaitan dana Armada di hadapan panel tiga hakim Mahkamah Rayuan terdiri daripada Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, Datuk Azman Abdullah dan Datuk Noorin Badaruddin. Wan Shaharuddin berkata Syed Saddiq dalam pembelaannya mendakwa beliau tidak pernah mengeluarkan arahan itu namun hujahan peguamnya menyatakan arahan untuk ‘clear’ adalah simpan dengan selamat. “Sekiranya wang tersebut bukan suatu kesalahan, kenapa tertuduh minta SP13 ‘clearkan’ wang itu. Ini bermakna tertuduh ada niat jahat,” katanya sambil menambah Menteri Belia dan Sukan itu telah melakukan kesalahan bersubahat dengan cara mengarahkan Rafiq Hakim untuk melakukan jenayah berkenaan. Wan Shaharuddin berhujah terdapat keterangan yang menunjukkan Syed Saddiq telah mengarahkan Rafiq Hakim mengeluarkan wang RM1 juta itu pada 6 Mac 2020. Beliau berkata justeru itu, keputusan Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi mensabitkan dan menjatuhi hukuman ke atas Syed Saddiq berlandaskan undang-undang serta keterangan adalah tepat. “Tiada kekhilafan di pihak hakim bicara sehingga membawa kepada salah laku keadilan yang memerlukan campur tangan Mahkamah Rayuan. “Justeru itu, kami mohon agar sabitan terhadap pertuduhan subahat pecah amanah ini tidak diganggu,” katanya. Timbalan Pendakwa Raya Farah Ezlin Yusop Khan pula berhujah tiada pengeluaran wang sumbangan yang dikumpulkan oleh Armada menerusi dua program pada April 2018 untuk digunakan bagi kempen Syed Saddiq dalam Pilihan Raya Umum ke-14 (PRU14). “Sebaliknya, Syed Saddiq mengubah niat dengan memindahkan wang sebanyak RM100,000 ke dalam akaun Amanah Saham Bumiputera miliknya selepas PRU14,“ katanya. Beliau berkata Syed Saddiq mengeluarkan resit perbelanjaan yang digunakan bagi PRU14 tetapi itu tidak bermakna wang tersebut berpunca daripada dananya sendiri. “Tiada bukti yang menunjukkan sumber wang yang digunakan dalam kempen itu sememangnya berasal daripada dana peribadi dan perlu dibayar balik,“ katanya. Selain itu, Farah Ezlin berkata keterangan Syed Saddiq berhubung pembayaran balik perbelanjaan bagi kempen PRU14 adalah perkara yang difikirkan kemudian kerana beliau tidak pernah memaklumkan kepada SP13 bahawa wang berkenaan adalah reimbursement. Hakim Ahmad Zaidi kemudian menetapkan 24 April ini sebagai pengurusan kes untuk menentukan tarikh keputusan kes itu. Pada 9 Nov 2023, Syed Saddiq dijatuhi hukuman penjara tujuh tahun dengan dua sebatan dan denda RM10 juta oleh Mahkamah Tinggi Kuala Lumpur selepas didapati bersalah atas empat pertuduhan bersubahat melakukan pecah amanah jenayah, salah guna harta serta pengubahan wang haram membabitkan dana Armada. Syed Saddiq, 32, didakwa bersubahat dengan Rafiq Hakim, yang diamanahkan dengan dana Armada berjumlah RM1 juta, untuk melakukan pecah amanah dengan menyalahgunakan dana itu di CIMB Bank Berhad, Menara CIMB KL Sentral, Jalan Sentral 2 di sini pada 6 Mac 2020. Beliau turut didakwa menyalahgunakan harta untuk diri sendiri iaitu wang RM120,000 daripada akaun Maybank Islamic Berhad milik Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise dengan menyebabkan Rafiq Hakim melupuskan wang tersebut di Malayan Banking Berhad, Jalan Pandan 3/6A, Taman Pandan Jaya di sini antara 8 dan 21 April 2018. Bekas Ketua Armada itu juga berdepan dua pertuduhan melibatkan diri dalam aktiviti pengubahan wang haram, iaitu memindahkan wang masing-masing RM50,000 dalam akaun Maybank Islamic Berhad miliknya ke akaun Amanah Saham Bumiputera miliknya, dipercayai merupakan hasil aktiviti haram, di sebuah bank di Jalan Persisiran Perling, Taman Perling, Johor Bahru pada 16 dan 19 Jun 2018.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:10:12 GMT",https://thesun.my/cerita/berita/tindakan-syed-saddiq-arah-clearkan-rm1-juta-tidak-jujur-pendakwaan-IN13963931,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,id,Today,50
Syed Saddiq’s instruction to “clear” RM1 million a dishonest act - Prosecution,"PUTRAJAYA : The Court of Appeal was today told that Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman’s action in ordering former Angkatan Bersatu Anak Muda (Armada) assistant treasurer Rafiq Hakim Razali to ‘clear’ the RM1 million withdrawn from its account was a dishonest act. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin said Syed Saddiq asked Rafiq Hakim, who is the 13th prosecution witness (SP13), to do so through a telephone conversation because he feared that the money would be seized by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). He said SP13 had told the court that he received the instruction from Syed Saddiq, despite the latter, in his defence, claiming that he did not give such an instruction. “When asked what was meant by ‘to clear’, SP13 replied, ‘Don’t keep the money in my house’ and when asked whether ’ clear’ means dispose (lupus), SP13 replied ‘Yes’,“ he said. Today is the third day trial of the appeal by Syed Saddiq, who is the Muar Member of Parliament, against his conviction and sentence on four charges of criminal breach of trust (CBT) and money laundering related to Armada funds. The hearing is before a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal comprising Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Noorin Badaruddin. Wan Shaharuddin said Syed Saddiq, who is the former Youth and Sports Minister, had committed the offence of abetment by instructing Rafiq Hakim to commit the crime. He said there was evidence showing that Syed Saddiq had instructed Rafiq Hakim to withdraw the RM1 million on March 6, 2020. As such, he said, the High Court judge had convicted and sentenced Syed Saddiq based on the law and correct evidence. “There was no error on the part of the trial judge that led to a miscarriage of justice that required the intervention of the Court of Appeal. Therefore, we request that the conviction on the charge of abetment of criminal breach of trust not be disturbed,” he said. Meanwhile, DPP Farah Ezlin Yusop Khan, who is also appearing for the prosecution, said there was no withdrawal of the money collected by Armada for use in Syed Saddiq’s campaign in the 14th General Election (GE14). “Instead, Syed Saddiq changed his mind by transferring the RM100,000 into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) account after GE14,“ she said, adding that Syed Saddiq did issue a receipt for expenses incurred for GE14, but that did not mean the money came from his own funds. She said there was no evidence to show that the source of the money used in the campaign came from Syed Saddiq’s personal funds and needed to be repaid. Syed Saddiq’s defence regarding the reimbursement was just an afterthought, she added. After hearing arguments from both parties, Judge Ahmad Zaidi set April 24 for case management to set a date for the verdict. On Nov 9, 2023, the Kuala Lumpur High Court sentenced Syed Saddiq, 32, to seven years imprisonment, two strokes of the cane, and an RM10 million fine after finding him guilty on four charges of abetting CBT, misusing property, and money laundering involving Armada’s funds. He was convicted of abetting former Armada assistant treasurer Rafiq Hakim Razali, who had been entrusted with RM1 million of party funds, in committing CBT by misappropriating the money at CIMB Bank Berhad, Menara CIMB KL Sentral, Jalan Sentral 2, on March 6, 2020. The former Youth and Sports Minister was also found guilty of misusing RM120,000 from an Armada Bumi Bersatu Enterprise account with Maybank Islamic Berhad by directing Rafiq Hakim to dispose of the funds at Malayan Banking Berhad, Jalan Pandan 3/6A, Taman Pandan Jaya, between April 8 and April 21, 2018. Additionally, the former Armada Chief was convicted on two counts of money laundering, involving the transfer of RM50,000 each from his Maybank Islamic Berhad account into his Amanah Saham Bumiputera account, believed to be illegal proceeds, at a bank in Jalan Persisiran Perling, Taman Perling, Johor Bahru, on June 16 and 19, 2018.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:04:51 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/syed-saddiq-s-instruction-to-clear-rm1-million-a-dishonest-act-prosecution-LN13963877,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
US-China: the clash of the titans,"PARIS: As the trade war between the United States and China escalates, here is a point-by-point comparison of the world's two biggest economic powers. Geographic, demographic giants With a surface area of more than nine million square kilometres (3.5 million square miles) each, the United States and China rank among the world's four biggest countries, after Russia and Canada. China, the world's second most populous country after India with 1.4 billion inhabitants, has four times more people than the United States. Economic powers The United States is the world's biggest economy, with a gross domestic product of more than $29 trillion in 2024, followed by China with more than $18 trillion, according to the International Monetary Fund. China was in 2024 the world's biggest exporter of goods, totalling $3.6 trillion and the United States the biggest importer at $3.4 trillion, according to the World Trade Organization. The United States has a big trade deficit with China when it comes to goods, reaching $355 billion in 2024, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has slapped 145 percent tariffs on many Chinese imports. Beijing has retaliated with levies on US goods of 125 percent. Biggest polluters China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by the United States. The United States had committed itself to slashing its emissions by half by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, but Trump, openly sceptical about climate change, has announced a new withdrawal of his country from the Paris climate accord. China committed itself to stabilising its CO2 emissions by 2030 and then to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Digital giants The United States is home to the “GAFAM” group of tech titans: Google, Apple, Facebook owner Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. China has its own tech giants, “BATX”: search engine Baidu, e-commerce platform Alibaba, video game and social media firm Tencent and smartphone maker Xiaomi. The rise of artificial intelligence has opened a new front in Sino-American tech rivarly. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, AI generative models have mushroomed in the United States and China. The Chinese start-up DeepSeek, founded in 2023 by the High-Flyer investment fund, shook up the AI world in January with its R1 chatbot, able to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost. The two sides have also clashed over TikTok. The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has more than 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law passed last year that orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or get shut down in the United States. The ban took effect in January but Trump has delayed it until June 19 to give time to find a buyer for TikTok. The ban is motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government Military powers The United States is the world's biggest spender on defence. It earmarked $916 billion in 2023, three times more than China, which ranked second with $296 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The United States and Russia have nearly 90 percent of the world's nuclear arsenal, with more than 5,000 nuclear warheads each at the start of 2024, including those withdrawn and waiting to be dismantled. That is far before China which has 10 times fewer nuclear warheads. The space race China, which sent its first “taikonaut” into space in 2003, has over the past decades invested billions of dollars in its space programme to catch up with the United States and Russia. In 2019 its Chang'e-4 made a controlled landing on the far side of the Moon, a world first. In 2021 it landed a small robot on Mars. It hopes by 2030 to send a manned mission to the Moon, and plans to build a lunar base. NASA's Artemis space programme is planning to return astronauts to the Moon in 2027 and future missions to Mars. In order to reduce the mission costs, the US space agency has partnered with private companies to send material and technology to the Moon.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:17:51 GMT",https://thesun.my/world-news/us-china-the-clash-of-the-titans-NN13963860,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
"Man arrested for allegedly stealing grandmother, grand daughters’ underwear","PETALING JAYA : A man whose face was clearly captured via CCTV while stealing women’s undergarments at a residence in Kamping Baru Rasah, Seremban, has been arrested by the police on Wednesday. Seremban district police chief, Assistant Commissioner Mohamad Hatta Che Din said the suspect, a man in his 40s, was arrested when he arrived at the police station at around 9am, yesterday. “Following investigations, we managed to identify the suspect and called him to the police station to surrender,“ he told Sinar Harian. The Malay daily had earlier reported that the mystery behind missing underwear on the clotheslines and hanging rack was solved when the home’s CCTV footage recorded the act of the suspect. The suspect was seen stopping his lorry  by the victim’s house before entering the house and committing the act. The victim, who wishes to be identified as Cik Lai, 27, claimed that this was not the first time that underwear had gone missing from her house. “When my late grandmother was still alive, her underwear that was drying in the garage had also gone missing, but at that time we didn’t take it seriously. “I started to notice when both my sister and I were losing our underwear that was drying in the garage beginning to go missing and on one occasion up to seven pairs at once,“ she was quoted as saying. She further explained that the first incident was successfully recorded on January 31, showing the suspect driving a Proton Wira to inspect the area near the house before returning to commit the act. “What is surprising is that the suspect did not cover his face at all. “The latest incident was yesterday (Tuesday) at 4.30pm which clearly shows the suspect jumping into the fence of the house and stealing underwear from the hanger which he then put inside his shirt,“ she added, having lodged a police report following the incident.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:53:33 GMT",https://thesun.my/viral/going-viral/man-arrested-for-allegedly-stealing-grandmother-grand-daughters-underwear-KN13963797,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
KL Tower to be reopened as soon as possible - Fahmi,"KUALA LUMPUR : The Kuala Lumpur Tower, which is temporarily closed from today for maintenance works and to resolve safety issues, will be reopened as soon as possible. Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil said the telecommunications tower would be promptly opened to visitors after the two key aspects are resolved by the new concessionaire, LSH Service Master Sdn Bhd (LSHSM). “The new concessionaire requires a little time to implement the relevant work thoroughly to ensure the safety of visitors,” said Fahmi, who is also the MADANI Government spokesperson. He said this at the weekly media conference at Angkasapuri here today, which was also attended by Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching, and Communications Ministry secretary-general Datuk Mohamad Fauzi Md Isa. Fahmi said that a team from the ministry visited the KL Tower recently and found that a lot of things, including the kitchen utensils at the revolving restaurant, are not in good condition for visitors. “In addition, there are also safety-related aspects that are concerning and immediate action is required, among them being the railing at the deck that had been lowered,” he said. Commenting on the status of the 205 staff from the previous concessionaire, Menara Kuala Lumpur Sdn Bhd (MKLSB), Fahmi said that 193 of them had accepted the job offer from LSHSM. “Based on the notice of termination of service (to MKLSB staff) on Dec 18 last year, all 205 employees ended their service on March 31, which was the first day of Hari Raya. The ministry had asked the new company (LSHSM) to take in all these workers because they have been working at the KL Tower for years and are very experienced. “One of the main conditions in the offer to the 205 employees is that LSHSM must offer them salaries that are no less favourable than what they were paid by the previous company,” he said. The Communications Ministry said in a statement yesterday that the KL Tower would be temporarily closed starting today for the safety and comfort of visitors, and to allow the new management to carry out maintenance and improvement works.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:49:56 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/kl-tower-to-be-reopened-as-soon-as-possible-fahmi-KN13963768,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50

We don’t want them to visit Johor just once,” he said. “Likewise, proficiency in English is a fundamental skill that must be strengthened to attract more international visitors to the state,” he told reporters after the Visit Johor Year 2026 Townhall session organised by Tourism Johor today. Onn Hafiz noted that 33 tourism infrastructure projects are in progress from last year and this year, with a combined allocation of RM116.35 million. He said these projects are part of the state government’s efforts to ensure the success of Visit Johor Year 2026, which aims to attract 12 million domestic and international tourists. “Ongoing projects include the upgrading of Mount Ledang, Phase Two of the Johor Zoo enhancement, the redevelopment of Kampung Sungai Melayu, the opening of the Royal Botanical Garden, and the launch of the Abu Bakar Royal Museum at Istana Besar Johor,” he said. “It is time to elevate Johor’s tourism sector to its full potential. The state has many attractions that have not been effectively promoted in the past. But all that is about to change,” he added.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:45:41 GMT",https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/mb-urges-tourism-sector-to-enhance-hospitality-english-proficiency-for-visit-johor-year-2026-BN13963741,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
Trump administration proposes scrapping UN peacekeeping funding,"WASHINGTON: The White House budget office has proposed eliminating funding for United Nations peacekeeping missions, citing failures by operations in Mali, Lebanon and Democratic Republic of Congo, according to internal planning documents seen by Reuters. Washington is the U.N.'s largest contributor - with China second - accounting for 22% of the $3.7 billion core regular U.N. budget and 27% of the $5.6 billion peacekeeping budget. These payments are mandatory. The proposed peacekeeping cuts are included in a so-called “Passback,“ the response by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to State Department funding requests for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The overall plan wants to slash the State Department budget by about half. The new budget must be approved by Congress, and lawmakers could decide to restore some or all of the funding the administration has proposed cutting. The State Department was due to respond to the OMB proposal on Tuesday. During U.S. President Donald Trump's first term he proposed cutting about a third of diplomacy and aid budgets. But Congress, which sets the federal government budget, pushed back on Trump's proposal. “There is no final plan, final budget,“ State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the OMB proposals. The OMB has proposed ending Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA). “For example, Passback provides no funding for CIPA, ending contributions for international peacekeeping due to the recent failures in peacekeeping, such as with MINUSMA, UNIFIL, and MONUSCO, and the disproportionately high level of assessments,“ according to an excerpt from the Passback. U.S. in arrears The United Nations peacekeeping budget funds nine missions in Mali, Lebanon, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Western Sahara, Cyprus, Kosovo, between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Abyei, an administrative area that is jointly run by South Sudan and Sudan. The OMB Passback also proposed the creation of a $2.1 billion America First Opportunities Fund (A1OF), which it said would be used to cover a limited set of foreign economic and development assistance priorities. “Should the Administration seek to pay any assessments for the United Nations Regular Budget or peacekeeping assessments, we would look to provide that funding from the A1OF,“ read the OMB Passback. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric on Tuesday declined to comment on “what appears to be a leaked memo that is part of an internal debate within the U.S. government.” The U.S. owes - for arrears and the current fiscal year - nearly $1.5 billion for the regular U.N. budget and nearly $1.2 billion for the peacekeeping budget. A country can be up to two years in arrears before facing the possible repercussion of losing its vote in the 193-member General Assembly. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month said he is seeking ways to improve efficiency and cut costs as the world body turns 80 this year amid a cash crisis.","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:54:55 GMT",https://thesun.my/world-news/trump-administration-proposes-scrapping-un-peacekeeping-funding-EN13963722,The Sun Daily,Malaysia,en,Today,50
